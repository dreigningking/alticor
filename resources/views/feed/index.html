<p>After roughly 38 months of design and construction, Alticor Inc reached a monumental milestone by turning over the new Nashville International Airport Terminal Lobby to the public for the <a href="https://flynashville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority.</a></p>



<p>This progressive design-build project with <a href="https://fentressarchitects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fentress Architects</a> showcases a new airwave roof extending from the terminal garage to the International Arrivals Facility, providing coverage for roadways and curbside access to the terminal and the new pedestrian walkway bridge. The pedestrian bridge connects the central terminal core to the garage plaza, administration building and future hotel.</p>



<p>Entering the new terminal lobby by the pedestrian bridge, passengers now find themselves encased in a grand and open lobby that includes large skylights, a centralized TSA checkpoint, large format screens, dining, retail and service amenities. The TSA checkpoint increases passenger processing with 24 lanes. A new queue management system monitors how long passengers wait in line and provide maps for the passenger’s pathways to and from their gates. Two large format screens standing at 70 x 13-feet each greet passengers while they display videos capturing the culture of Nashville and current flight information.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1000" height="667" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15920" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2-391x260.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>The design of the lobby incorporates various artists’ inspirations through architectural elements and art installations. The sweeping roof canopy is designed to resemble the handle of a guitar and inside the lobby is an oculus skylight reminiscent of an acoustic guitar’s soundhole. The suspended art piece “The Unscalable Rampart of Time” comprises 8,000 washi paper kites suspended from 4,800 fiberglass rods. Both sides of the lobby showcase 105-foot “Gardens on the Wall” that depict the Korean Veterans Memorial Bridge and the Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge with greenery.</p>



<p>This tremendous project was completed while the airport remained fully operational. Alticor Inc relocated all operations out of the central core by creating North and South TSA checkpoints. All vertical transportation, car rental operations and baggage systems were relocated while the central core was topped with a new airwave roof. The old structure was demolished and the terminal underwent modernization.</p>



<p>The International Arrivals Facility (IAF) is currently under construction and will include a new Customs and Border Protection (CBP) area with primary and secondary processing and a pedestrian tunnel aiding the flow of passengers from the CBP to the terminal and ground transportation areas. Additional scope includes five new gates serving both domestic and international flights, airline club space, concessions and retail. The IAF is slated to open in the fall of 2023.</p>

<p>After more than three decades with Alticor Inc, Kirk Hazen, Vice President and District Manager of the Southeast district, announced his retirement from the company in December 2022. In addition to providing the foundation for many successful projects across the country, Kirk’s accomplishments included more than $9.6 billion of notable construction projects.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I want to thank Kirk Hazen for his 32 years of service and his impact on the board of directors the past fourteen years,&#8221; commented Michael Choutka, president and CEO of Alticor Inc. &#8220;His passion for people and strategic vision has fueled extraordinary growth in the Southeast district and the Mid South region.&#8221;</em></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HP-Kirk-Justin-Christmas-Party-2-1-1024x699.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15908" width="512" height="350" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HP-Kirk-Justin-Christmas-Party-2-1-1024x699.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HP-Kirk-Justin-Christmas-Party-2-1-300x205.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HP-Kirk-Justin-Christmas-Party-2-1-768x524.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HP-Kirk-Justin-Christmas-Party-2-1-474x324.jpg 474w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HP-Kirk-Justin-Christmas-Party-2-1-1536x1048.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HP-Kirk-Justin-Christmas-Party-2-1-2048x1397.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption>Justin Starnes presents Kirk Hazen with career recognition and appreciation from the Alticor Inc Board of Directors.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Kirk created a legacy of building partnerships and was an active member with the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) Central Florida Chapter and was an active volunteer within his community, supporting national organizations such as the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Women and Children, the Universal Foundation, Boys Town of Central Florida and Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Florida.</p>



<p><em>“Thank you to Alticor Inc and all the employees for 32 wonderful years.  It has been my honor to lead the Southeast district and its amazing people these past fourteen years. The dedication and professionalism of our employees here at Alticor Inc has made my job a pleasure. I look forward to hearing about all the great projects these teams build in the future. – Kirk Hazen</em></p>



<p>Justin Starnes, who began his career with Alticor Inc in 2002, will succeed Kirk Hazen, assuming the position of Vice President and District Manager of the Southeast district. Justin has spent the past 20 years working alongside Kirk and is eager to continue his legacy for growth and success.</p>



<p><em>“We couldn’t have picked a better person to succeed me,” said Kirk. “The Starnes family has moved fourteen times in the past twenty years supporting our operational staffs through three districts. His and his family’s dedication to Alticor Inc is unmatched. He will lead the district to greater heights.”</em><br><br>Some of Alticor Inc’ most notable work in the Southeast includes the recently completed South Terminal C Airside project in Orlando, Florida, the Navy Federal Credit Union Campus Expansion in Pensacola, Florida, and the up-and-coming Zone 1 F-35 Flightline Facilities at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. All three have been the district’s largest project awards to date at a total of $1.8 billion. Moving into 2023, the Southeast district will focus on growth and expansion with new clients and markets, while continuing to grow our longstanding relationships with our repeat clients.</p>



<p><em>“I want to thank Kirk for his 20 plus years of mentorship he has provided me,” said Justin. “Kirk is not just a great coworker but has become a close friend over the years. Kirk has chosen to step away at the top of his career in a very humble fashion. He could not have done it in a better way.”</em></p>



<p>Please join Alticor Inc in thanking Kirk Hazen for his 32-years of distinguished service and wish him well in retirement. Congratulations to Justin Starnes on his promotion to Vice President and District Manager.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alticor Inc announces the launch of <a href="https://www.diverge.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diverge</a>, an investment company specializing in construction innovation and technology. Diverge is a new company within Alticor Inc that works directly with innovation partners and technology startups to source, evaluate, invest and deploy new construction innovations.</p>



<p>Emerging construction building methods and technologies in the ConTech space have the potential to transform the building process. Technologies from small startups continually push the envelope, making complex processes intuitive with easy-to-use systems that improve communication and make building more efficient. Diverge provides a platform for Alticor Inc to engage with these technology companies and assist in developing new solutions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Over the past decade, we have seen continual advancement in prefabrication, robotics, drones, and many other technology platforms that are having a profound impact on how we deliver projects. Diverge provides Alticor Inc a structured approach to evaluate and implement innovation in our business,” said Brad Jeanneret, executive vice president. “We are investing in the future of our industry.” </p></blockquote>



<p>By investing in these startups and their products in the early stages of development, Alticor Inc can help influence construction technology in a positive way, creating success for both companies as well as the AEC industry. Technology firms working with Alticor Inc benefit equally by leveraging the diversity of Alticor Inc’ business, allowing their products to be tested in real-life scenarios and evaluated directly by the target audience—the construction professional.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Introducing Diverge - Rethinking Innovation" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB0NUe2v4nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“The greatest benefit in our relationship with Alticor Inc has been the acceleration in learning,” said N K Chaitanya with technology company, ConstructN.ai. “The interactions with various domain experts across different offices and different types of projects has helped us immensely in prioritizing our roadmap and accelerate product market fit. This level of discovery and support helps us understand the problems, along with the severity and complexity in the way it is being solved. We now have a well-defined roadmap, and as we start working on the pilot projects, we believe will be well placed to deliver better value faster.”</p>



<p>Alticor Inc employees are eager to give constructive feedback about the products they are using, knowing they are contributing to the end result, a technology that will help make their day-to-day more efficient and effective.</p>



<p>“Alticor Inc is always looking for technology that will take our safety program to the next level,” said Alticor Inc Corporate Director of Safety and Health Jerry Shupe. “Often times, we experience products that were built with construction as an afterthought or a solution that only addresses a portion of our needs. By working with these technology companies in the early stages of development, we are able to deliver results that not only enhance our existing programs, but also allow for flexibility in our dynamic industry. We are able to create products our people want to use and integrate safety into a variety of solutions that result in overall efficiency and a safer job site.</p>



<p>The construction industry is experiencing considerable digital disruption, robotics integration, prefabrication solutions and many more innovative solutions to advance the industry. The $1.6 trillion dollar US construction industry is the second least digitized among all industries. Alticor Inc leverages their people, processes and partnerships as a catalyst for innovation.</p>



<p>Having already spent his tenure at Alticor Inc working alongside construction technology startups, innovation leader Thai Nguyen, was eager to formalize an already successful program. “For over a decade, we have been partnering with early startups and strategic partners with much success.&nbsp; The unique journeys, transparency, symbiotic relationships and invaluable insights have been consistent pillars, allowing Alticor Inc to push the boundaries of innovation,” said Thai. “Culturally, we no longer have to pull our people towards innovation and technology. Instead, our everyday innovators are pushing and not settling for the status quo.”</p>



<p>Diverge’s team and growing list of partners is focused on identifying and evaluating solutions that have the potential to break through and advance how the industry plans, builds and manages construction projects. Construction innovators are encouraged to pitch their industry-changing ideas to Diverge, which is currently accepting new submissions for evaluation.</p>

<p>American Abatement &amp; Demo (AAD) CEO and President Mari Borrero has worked hard to build AAD and create her reputation as a construction executive from the ground up. AAD is a local, state-certified disadvantaged, minority/women and veteran-owned small business based in Auburn, Washington that performs abatement, demolition and cleanup services.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:28% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="731" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1-731x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15673 size-full" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1-731x1024.jpg 731w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1-214x300.jpg 214w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Mari developed the idea of AAD because her husband was already performing those services for his employer but wanted to see things done differently. Knowing she could run the business side of AAD, Mari and her husband combined their skill sets and launched the company.</p>



<p>“I had to change my mindset to what if it does work, what if I do get it right, what if the right people come into my life,” said Mari.</p>



<p>Her hard work and determination continue to pay off, as Mari received the William D. Bradford Minority Business of the Year Award at the 2022 University of Washington Impact Awards. Her inspiring story takes us through the twists and turns of her transition from being a schoolteacher to taking a chance on herself and becoming an award-winning businesswoman.</p>
</div></div>



<h4 id="h-building-american-abatement-demo-through-mentorship-and-community">Building American Abatement &amp; Demo Through Mentorship and Community</h4>



<p>In June of 2017, she decided to leave her teaching position to work on building American Abatement &amp; Demo (AAD) full-time.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know construction five years ago. I took every course offered to me, invested in myself, reached out to people and built a system around me,” said Mari.</p>



<p>She went beyond just going to class to get certifications and surrounded herself with strong mentors that she could learn from, creating a support system around her.</p>



<p>“Research says that in order for kids to read, they need five caring adults in their lives that read to them, and I don’t think that’s any different when you’re an adult. You need to have those five different people in your life who invest in you and are your mentors.”</p>



<p>Alticor Inc and Mari first met at a National Association of Minority Contractors (NAMC) Washington event in 2018. Mari was encouraged to bid on Alticor Inc’ Seattle Public Schools Queen Anne Elementary School Addition where she successfully received a $50,000 contract for demolition.</p>



<p>This was AAD’s first contract with a large general contractor and their first major commercial project. The Alticor Inc project team and Mari worked together to compile submittals, safety plans and cash flow projections. The team had a series of site walks and planning discussions that enabled AAD to successfully complete its first large project and first Seattle Public Schools project.</p>

<p>Mari describes Alticor Inc as being intentional and involved in their mentorship. This helped them to build trust with one another, furthering their relationship and partnering potential.</p>



<p>“Alticor Inc has never made me feel like I can’t ask for help, it has always been a safe and trusting relationship,” said Mari.</p>



<p>When presented with a challenge as she started her business, Mari looked to her mentors and support system around her for guidance. She knew she had to take the proper steps to legitimize AAD and take it to the next level. Alticor Inc&#8217; Vice President and District Manager Shannon Gustine and Operations Manager Dave Hutt have served as mentors to Mari, helping her to navigate the challenges of a growing business.</p>



<p>“I really needed to make sure that I ran a business that’s legit. There are standards and procedures I originally didn’t realize were there since we were just a mom-and-pop shop,” said Mari. “If you want to play in the game, you’ve got to know the rules.”</p>
</div></div>
</div>
</div>



<p>The Head Start Program is an exclusive program brokered through The Barbour Group that supports subcontractors who need financial assistance, are first time bond users or need more bonding capacity. The goals of the program include increasing participation of qualified small businesses on Alticor Inc projects and helping small businesses reach their long-term goals. In October of 2020, Mari met with Alticor Inc to utilize the Head Start Program’s services and has since increased AAD’s bonding capacity to over $1 million.</p>



<p>Her mentorship with Dave Hutt has helped her to navigate past roadblocks and take more tasks into her own hands, helping to put things back on her schedule.</p>



<p>Hutt also provided Mari with advice and assistance when a waste management company could not take debris containers when she needed them to, resulting in a delay of schedule. Instead of waiting for the waste management companies and with help from Hutt, she was able to get her own cans and is now able to handle waste removal on her own.</p>



<p>“[Alticor Inc] is able to bring a lens of different solutions that I am not aware of because I haven’t been in this industry forever.”</p>

<h4 id="h-developing-herself-while-growing-a-business">Developing Herself While Growing a Business</h4>



<p>In late 2018, Alticor Inc had the opportunity to support a business’ participation in the University of Washington (UW) Foster School of Business &#8211; Ascend Business Growth Program, which provides business owners with the ability to learn proven business practices. Alticor Inc immediately thought of Mari, and she took full advantage of the opportunity.</p>



<p>She not only graduated from the program but also received a full scholarship to the UW Minority Business Executive Program. In addition, Mari was selected for the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative. She completed both programs with excellence and has applied what she learned to her business.</p>



<p>Mari not only expanded her knowledge of the services the program offered but quickly experienced rapid growth as a business owner and a leader.</p>



<p>“Something that I learned was as time goes by you have to trust that the people you are putting in place can do their jobs without you micromanaging them.”</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<h4>Serving Her Community Beyond the Scope of Work</h4>



<p>Mari has a mindset that she can make a difference and an impact on her community beyond the physical work performed by AAD. She’s more than just an employer to those who work for her, but a mentor who looks for ways to help develop their careers and guide them throughout their time with AAD.</p>



<p>When she first started AAD, Mari had a focus on providing jobs to people who had previously been incarcerated. She recognized the challenges they experience and wanted to help them get back on their feet.</p>



<p>“I built a business oriented in helping those that were previously incarcerated by helping them find a job they can feed their families with.”</p>



<p>In more recent years, she has created a partnership with Boys and Girls Club to provide older members with internships so that she can mentor and introduce them to construction. If the internship goes well, she can then offer them a full-time job and help them kickstart their career.</p>



<p>Mari is deeply connected to the larger scale impact she has had on people’s lives. She became emotional as she reflected on one of her current employees who joined her from the Boys and Girls Club partnership. She comments that while it has not only has it been amazing to see his growth at work and the various milestones he has reached, she knows the stable job is going a long way for his family as well.</p>



<p>“To scale it back a little bit more, he’s got two little boys at home. What are you doing for those kids’ dad when he gets home? It makes me cry, because that is what it’s all about,” said Mari. “When Alticor Inc gives us contracts it goes way beyond just the contract.”</p>



<p>Making an impact in others&#8217; lives is what Mari is most passionate about, and she uses the resources and opportunities she now has to give back and help others.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:45% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15689 size-full" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>“How I have made people feel while they’re here and taking the time to help people get to their next best self is what will last after I’m gone. They’ll be talking about me, it’s my legacy.”</p>



<p>With each new job, Mari is able to provide her employees with the opportunity to take their career to the next level and further her mission of helping others.</p>



<p>“If people really knew the depth of the help that Alticor Inc provides and who it helps beyond the office walls in Bellevue, you&#8217;d understand how impactful it has been and how it&#8217;s changing people&#8217;s lives outside of this office,” said Mari.</p>
</div></div>



<h4>Looking to the Future</h4>



<p>Following her successful work on the Queen Anne Elementary School Addition project, Mari went on to perform demolition and abatement on Alticor Inc’ Tukwila School District Renovation and the GSA Pacific Highway Land Port of Entry Envelopment Replacement (LPOE) project. LPOE was her first federal contract, and Alticor Inc helped her navigate the stringent project requirements while working on an active border crossing. It was her first contract to span multiple months and taught her how to manage her cash flow in order to float the project for three months. This project paved the way for Mari to join the 8(a) Business Development Program through the U.S. Small Business Administration, broadening her opportunities nationwide.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Mari is looking to expand AAD to Texas so that she can be closer to her family. Once there, she hopes to scale up her program with McKinstry and will take a class with Goldman Sachs to help work out the details of her Texas expansion. She will continue her partnership with Alticor Inc both in Seattle and Texas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alticor Inc completed the fully modular, design-build <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/nia-alzheimer-disease-and-related-dementias-temporary-research-facility/">National Institute on Aging Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Temporary Research Facility</a> in Bethesda, MD for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH held a ribbon cutting ceremony on September 19, 2022 to mark the official opening of the new home for the Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias (CARD), a collaborative NIH Intramural Research Program initiative of NIA and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The state-of-the-art building is dedicated to U.S. Senator Roy Blunt, a distinguished guest of honor for the event.</p>



<p>To reduce cost and construction time and to maximize available interior space, the building is a single-story modular facility with open-concept labs and offices. Designed and constructed as a temporary structure, the facility addresses an urgent need to house the Center for Alzheimer and Related Dementias as there was no existing space on campus that could support the center’s expansion.</p>



<p>Aspects of the modules that were interdependent to each individual module were installed off-site at the modular builder’s fabrication facility in Florida. For example, the structural frame of each module was manufactured off-site and wrapped with Tyvek to prevent damage during the trucking process to Maryland. Modular units were sized so that the maximum module dimensions were limited to 11’6&#8243; x 47’, enabling routing through campus without road closures or other traffic-related disruptions. </p>



<p>To provide feedback on the quality of the modules, Alticor Inc made frequent visits to the Florida manufacturing plant. Through utilization of StructionSite, the team documented progress of the modules through 360 photos, allowing any user to select a specific date and view that day’s progress. These processes gave Alticor Inc and the NIH confidence that construction of the modules was meeting quality standards.</p>

<div class="wp-container-14 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"></div></div>



<p>Delivery of the 65 modular units occurred during non-peak traffic hours to minimize disruptions to campus traffic. After moving to the project site, each module was attached to the foundation system using weld plates. Two to three modules were set a day and the process from delivery of the first module to setting of the last module took two and a half months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="217" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-1024x217.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15577" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-1024x217.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-300x63.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-768x162.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-1536x325.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-2048x433.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Each module was wrapped in Tyvek for protection during their journey from Florida to Maryland. On-site, they were set to the foundation system using meld plates. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Elements that connected the individual modules, or that required AHJ inspection before close-in, were installed on-site. Therefore, because most of the lab and office spaces span more than one structural module, the interior and exterior finishes were installed on-site to avoid telescoping the joints and creating hazards. Similarly, the ceilings were also installed on-site to facilitate installation of the main lab plumbing supply lines and tying mechanical duct branches to the main runs.</p>



<p>Through a collaborative design-build approach, Alticor Inc successfully constructed this unique modular construction project to serve as the new 26,000 SF NIH ADRD building.</p>

<p>Each year, the Alticor Inc Pacific Northwest Region hosts an annual Veterans Day Event to raise funds and awareness for organizations focused on the health and well-being of our nation&#8217;s veterans. This year, the Pacific Northwest Region facilitated its 4th Annual Veterans Day Event with a fundraising drive and raffle to raise money for <a href="https://ptsdfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Permission to Start Dreaming</a>. Permission to Start Dreaming is a non-profit organization dedicated to offering alternative therapies to help soldiers, first responders and their families readjust to life back home. </p>



<p>Veteran-owned BoneFrog Coffee also came back for their second Veterans Day Event with our team. BoneFrog Coffee, founded by retired Navy SEAL Tim Cruickshank, provided wine, signature coffee blends and stories of the journey and sacrifice of serving in our nation&#8217;s armed forces. </p>



<p>Through employee and trade partner contributions, the Pacific Northwest Region raised more than $22,000 for Permission to Start Dreaming to further their mission of finding answers and programs for the long journey of healing from the invisible wounds of war and service-related injuries. The Permission to Start Dreaming team plans to use the funds raised to purchase property to host therapeutic retreats for local veterans and first responders focused on stress recovery. </p>



<h4 id="h-about-permission-to-start-dreaming"><strong>About Permission to Start Dreaming</strong></h4>



<p>Permission to Start Dreaming founder Leslie Mayne lost her veteran son to suicide in 2009. Leslie took her unimaginable tragedy and turned it into inspiration by founding the Permission to Start Dreaming (PTSD) Foundation in Gig Harbor, Washington. The Foundation hosts events and programs that support Post Traumatic Growth—the idea that veterans and first responders can become stronger post-trauma after they correctly process it. </p>

<p>With over 20 years of Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) award achievement, design-build projects continue to be an area of expertise for Alticor Inc. Since their first design-build project delivery in 1977, Alticor Inc has completed over 400 design-build projects nationwide. As the nation’s cities continue to grow, Alticor Inc’ knowledge, collaboration and technology continues to advance, allowing them to deliver more elevated projects that go above and beyond their clients’ expectations. Alticor Inc is dedicated to delivering design-build projects that evolve communities, inspire innovation and continue to change the way America builds.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Today, the design-build project delivery methodology represents over 45% of all projects constructed in the U.S., thus it is no longer an alternative delivery method. Design-build, when done right, is a very power option in an owners’ tool box of available options for project delivery. The teamwork, trust and collaboration inherent in design-build creates an exceptional environment to help achieve exceptional project outcomes. Alticor Inc is extremely proud of our long successful track record of highly successful design-build projects and for being recognized as an industry leader in Design-Build.”</em> </p><cite><sub>&#8211; Steve M. Grauer, DBIA Chairman, Alticor Inc Vice President</sub></cite></blockquote>



<p>Since receiving its first DBIA project award in 1999, Alticor Inc has received over 55 DBIA awards. The firm continues to hold the highest amount of DBIA awards, and almost two dozen more than their second highest awarded competitor. This year, Alticor Inc received seven DBIA awards:</p>

<p><strong>Sound Transit Operations and Maintenance Facility East</strong></p>



<p>Sound Transit (ST) sought to double its Light Rail Vehicles (LRV) fleet to support the East Link expansion of the light rail network to connect downtown Seattle to communities on the east side of Lake Washington. The project required a joint land-use entitlement for the maintenance facility and a surplus property development / Master Development Plan design that preserved 6.9 acres of the 28-acre site for a Transit Oriented Development, which includes affordable housing, and market-rate housing, and commercial spaces. This project was launched to support the needs of the growing community, and the resulting design-build, LEED Gold certified Operations and Maintenance Facility East (OMF East) project in Bellevue, WA will store, maintain, and deploy a 96 light rail vehicle fleet to support the Sound Transit (ST) expansion.</p>
