This decision elevated Alticor Inc\u2019 position as an industry leader and demonstrated our commitment to investing in our employee owners. Since its inception, the mission of LDI, to foster personal engagement and challenging growth opportunities for everyone, has not only endured, but grown stronger as our company and the world around us has continued to evolve.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Core-Values-Horizontal-for-Light-BG-1024x117.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14151\" width=\"626\" height=\"70\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The people of Alticor Inc have embodied our core values from the inception of the company. In these words, our employees recognize who we are and feel the swell of pride that comes with being a part of this exceptional organization. While diversity and community have always been a priority, the events of 2020 would inspire us to live these words in a deeper and more meaningful way. In fact, the Alticor Inc family of employees and leaders sought ways to rise to the challenge of these times. They wanted to make a difference in our communities and in our company by learning to engage in true<strong> <\/strong>allyship and genuine\u2014 and at times\u2014difficult conversations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating the LDI Respectful Workplace training series was one natural step in helping employees grow as individuals and as leaders, to challenge our own thinking and to understand what it means to be an ally<strong> <\/strong>both inside and outside of Alticor Inc. The process of creating the first course in this series, Building an Inclusive and Respectful Workplace, involved employees at all levels and from all districts. This effort ensured the content would be not only relevant, but truly representative of our culture. Spearheaded by the board of directors, they advocated passionately for this program\u2019s intended goal of improving how we can work together to create a more inclusive and respectful work environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BT-Allyship-Article-Quote-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14153\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BT-Allyship-Article-Quote-1024x340.png 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BT-Allyship-Article-Quote-300x100.png 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BT-Allyship-Article-Quote-768x255.png 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/BT-Allyship-Article-Quote.png 1205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, our employees stepped up by initiating Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and community (DEIc) forums in each district. Each group charted its own course to find ways to make a difference through meaningful dialogue and connection. Through their shared passion, they assumed the roles of allies and leaders for their districts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our journey continued when DEIc became a formal goal for our company in 2021, accompanied by a new LDI Subtle Acts of Exclusion (SAE) course for all Alticor Inc leaders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, there is much more to come. Alticor Inc is creating more tools and resources to address the topics most important and impactful to our employees.
