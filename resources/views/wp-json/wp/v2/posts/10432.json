The Concourse D and Terminal Wings Expansion Project is a major project of the program, dubbed \u201cBNA Vision\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The 115,000 SF Concourse D features\u00a0six domestic aircraft gates, public art, and a variety of traveler amenities for passengers to enjoy. In addition to the new concourse, the project expanded the airport\u2019s Ticketing Lobby and Baggage Claim by adding 200,000 SF of space\u00a0to the north and south ends of the terminal. Other components of the project include remodeling 136,000 SF of existing terminal space and the construction of a 11,000 SF Central Utility Plant. As the new structures came online through the complex phasing of construction required at an active high-volume airport, the Alticor Inc team successfully orchestrated the relocation of every airline\u2019s ticketing operation and TSA security screening without interrupting a single flight. The relocation of ticketing and TSA sets the stage for the third project of The BNA Vision, the $330 million, 780,000 SF BNA Terminal Lobby and International Arrivals Facility, which was awarded to Alticor Inc in November 2018.<\/p>\n<p>The BNA Vision encompasses $1.4 billion of concurrent projects executed by four prime contractors. Each project is design-build and requires weekly program coordination meetings between the prime contractors and BNA to ensure that construction, site utilization and utility shut-down and start-up activities are sequenced accordingly to not disrupt airport operations and each projects schedule.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>\u201cThis is an extraordinary accomplishment! Concourse D was BNA\u2019s first progressive design-build project in their Vision Program. The complexity and speed of a project of this scale at one of the fastest growing airports required a true partnership between the BNA Staff, the Alticor Inc Design-Build Team, our local trade partners, and SMWBE firms. To be able to progress from the start of design 900 days ago to today and deliver to Nashville this expansion of world class quality while maintaining an outstanding safety record is extremely gratifying.\u201d <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Scott Shelby, Operations Manager, Alticor Inc<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Alticor Inc would like to thank each of our teaming partners who worked diligently to bring this project to completion including: Fentress Architects, Magnusson Klemencic Associates, I.C.
