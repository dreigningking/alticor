It allows project teams to analyze and coordinate digital models and other assets that will help them reduce project complications. VDC mitigates potential project issues by highlighting where problems may occur and provides data that will help illustrate possible solutions. In the past, these efforts would have been reserved for bigger and more complex projects, but as technologies modernize, VDC and Building Information Management (BIM) have become more accessible and realistic to have on all construction projects, no matter their size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tacoma Public Schools <a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/project\/fawcett-elementary-school-replacement\/\">Fawcett Elementary School Replacement<\/a> project (Fawcett), located in Tacoma, Washington, is a 50,000 SF building with a $33.8 million progressive design-build contract. The project is delivered with BLRB Architects and is scheduled to complete in July of 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Enscape_2022-05-23-16-02-50_small.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15394\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Enscape_2022-05-23-16-02-50_small.png 682w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Enscape_2022-05-23-16-02-50_small-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption>Rendering from BLRB Architects that shows the completed Fawcett Elementary School.

While his initial task was to implement standard VDC elements, he and the field team soon realized that VDC could greatly impact the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe pace of a smaller project really lends itself to having the capacity to explore,\u201d said Cardenas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, he took the initiative to create new tools for the team and understand which elements excited them and provided the most help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLike when you\u2019re cooking spaghetti, you throw it at the wall to see if it sticks, and that\u2019s what a smaller project allows me to do. I can throw something at the superintendents and see what their reaction is and what sticks,\u201d said Cardenas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of right timing and an excited on-site crew allowed Cardenas the opportunity to continue supporting the field team, and together they were able to turn Fawcett into a VDC playground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Elevating the owner\u2019s experience<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Fawcett had no expectations of VDC involvement or requirements during the construction phase, but it was something that the Alticor Inc team knew would benefit the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan Weinrich, senior VDC manager in the Pacific Northwest, and project superintendent Seth Stenerodden sat down early on in preconstruction to discuss design coordination. Together, they knew that even though there wasn\u2019t a requirement from the owner, they wanted to step in and lead the VDC process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stenerodden and area superintendent Thomas Browning spoke enthusiastically about how helpful VDC has been on the project and how it has allowed the project to run smoothly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVDC helps tremendously. It helps when coordinating with every single trade partner, and being able to see problems in the model before it\u2019s built in the field and is a huge benefit to the project, both cost and coordination wise,\u201d said Stenerodden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tacoma Public Schools was impressed by the initiative taken by the the on-site team, seeing the first-hand benefits of incorporating VDC into their project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVDC is new to the owner. They know about it but haven\u2019t used it on many other projects, so they\u2019ve mostly been an observer. We have really &#8216;wowed&#8217; them with the stuff that we have done, especially when we brought in their maintenance team while we were still in the design phase,\u201d said Kate Westerlund, project manager of Fawcett.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a VDC perspective, the tools that are developed and shared are typically project-specific and always with the end user in mind. Receiving input from both immediate field staff and those who would inevitably use and service the building was also an important step in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that the maintenance team could do their job with ease once the school was finished, the team invited the Tacoma School District Maintenance and Sustainability Group after most of the systems had been coordinated. They were then able to use the HoloLens (mixed reality smart glasses) to guarantee that all necessary equipment and devices were accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTheir head of maintenance was elated that we brought them in after it was coordinated. We used the HoloLens so they could walk around in virtual reality and physically see how they are going to be able to reach a piece of equipment that has frequent maintenance requirements,\u201d said Browning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These steps were impactful not only for the functionality of the design, but to help make the maintenance team feel seen and prioritized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey said, \u2018This is the first time anybody has asked us, much less listened to a request that we\u2019ve had,\u2019 so they really liked that from a maintenance standpoint,\u201d said Browning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Communicating with VDC<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the greatest draws to utilizing VDC is its ability to reduce miscommunications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe benefits are endless when it comes to being able to communicate, it\u2019s a communication tool essentially,\u201d said Stenerodden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A creative way the team utilized VDC technology was by using the orthographic photos gathered during the weekly drone flights to visually communicate upcoming schedules. Browning shared that when schedules are presented in a spreadsheet, the information can sometimes be confusing. To reduce confusion, Browning started putting the schedule on weekly site maps to help visualize where each activity was happening and make the schedule more digestible. The owner found this helpful and it became a key system for sharing the schedule with the team, owner and trade partners.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Schedule_Small.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15395\" width=\"836\" height=\"545\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Schedule_Small.png 634w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Schedule_Small-300x195.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px\" \/><figcaption>Upcoming construction schedule labeled on an orthographic photo to help visualize tasks. These schedules were created to help communicate workload with the owner, trade partners and the Alticor Inc team.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>\u201cOnce people have orthographic photos and see how they\u2019re used, they don\u2019t ever want to live life without them,\u201d said Browning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Office engineer Mac Nisbet said that one of his favorite features of VDC is its ability to solve problems before they happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt gives us the opportunity to coordinate between trades and solve a problem before it gets installed in the field,\u201d said Nisbet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using field iPads to access the 3D model while working in the field is also a shared favorite by the team. When solely referring to 2D models, there is more room for misinterpretations in the design, whereas 3D models make it easier to tell when, where and how each part is installed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to look at drawings, but it\u2019s nice to be able to pull the model up in a 3D view on the iPad and show a subcontractor exactly what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Ashton Corcoran, field engineer at Fawcett.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0850_small-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15396\" width=\"512\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0850_small-1024x684.jpg 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0850_small-300x200.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0850_small-768x512.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0850_small-391x260.jpg 391w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0850_small-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0850_small.jpg 1773w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption>Carlos Cardenas uses a field iPad at Fawcett Elementary School Replacement to check the work being done onsite. Through the field iPad, Cardenas can view the coordinated 3D model from any location on site. <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Mitigating constructability issues through training and teamwork<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common use of VDC on any given project is facilitating communication with and between trade partners during the construction phase. Teams utilize VDC for identifying design conflicts between all disciplines using Navisworks, a clash detection software that helps to mitigate constructibility issues in the field. This system works by analyzing the 3D model and identifying conditions that collide so the issues can be worked out before materials are ordered, fabricated and installed in the field. This technology also helps reduce delays and keeps the project on schedule by working out issues ahead of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are a 5.5-acre site, our overall building is 55,000 SF and we still have the same systems. If they aren\u2019t coordinated, whether it is small or large, it slows the schedule down,\u201d said Browning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VDC has proven to be a helpful and successful addition to the project, however, for a region with a VDC team of just three, it can be challenging to get each member fully immersed in each project. There is now a push to train the on-site teams to take over some of the responsibilities historically handled by VDC personnel such as running 3D coordination meetings with trade partners and recurring drone flights to help make some of the tasks independent within each project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSince Carlos was available, he came out, ran the operation and trained our younger people onsite to run the coordination. Due to Carlos\u2019 availability, we now have office and field engineers who could go to the next job and run this,\u201d said Westerlund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the understanding that younger employees are eager to learn this new technology, Area Superintendent Thomas Browning stated that team is focused on training their field and office engineers to take over some of the VDC tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While creating lift drawings has slowly migrated from a field engineers responsibility to a VDC engineers responsibility, Alticor Inc has made it a company-wide objective to put the effort back into the hands of field engineers. This is something Cardenas trained Ashton Corcoran to do early on, and Corcoran was able to successfully continue this effort throughout the project. Lift drawings are now independently created by the Fawcett team and are self-sustained within their project since Corcoran was able to take over and keep producing them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nisbet said the most helpful VDC tool for him was the lift drawings, which made a big difference in being able to do his job efficiently. \u201cThe lift drawings were huge because it was the only way we could have been as successful in the field as we were with our self-performed concrete,\u201d said Nisbet.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DJI_0490-edit-resized_small.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15397\" width=\"834\" height=\"551\"\/><figcaption>Alticor Inc VDC team documents progress at the Fawcett Elementary School Replacement project located in Tacoma, Wash. on Oct. 6, 2022.

The VDC team can offer helpful solutions and ideas that not everyone may be aware of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor any project starting up, talk to VDC, sit down with us and go through our menu of services. Even if it\u2019s not in the contract, just exploring the opportunities anyway, and exploring them early on, might allow our team to identify a possible solution that might not have been previously explored,\u201d said Cardenas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaway that almost every team member had to share was to get started earlier. VDC was brought in during preconstruction at Fawcett, but the team could have done even more if they had just started conversations earlier.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0148_small-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15398\" width=\"512\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0148_small-1024x684.jpg 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0148_small-300x200.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0148_small-768x512.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0148_small-391x260.jpg 391w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0148_small-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/DSC_0148_small.jpg 1773w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption>Carlos Cardenas prepares to fly the drone to take orthographic photos of Fawcett Elementary School Replacement project.

Not only does the onsite team want access to more VDC tools, but it is no longer as intimidating and expensive as it used to be. VDC is accessible and is something the onsite teams, trade partners and owners love and depend on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe success that I see on this job is driven by the staff\u2019s engagement with the tools and their willingness to learn something new,\u201d said Weinrich. \u201cEven though they don\u2019t have a big budget or a lot of time, they\u2019ve taken these tools and ran with them.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All things considered, VDC is still relatively new, and the tools are constantly developing along with the way they\u2019re being used. Through collaboration of the VDC and onsite teams the tools and processes are able to be developed to better fit onsite needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fawcett and VDC team have exceeded expectations for this project by encouraging others to get involved and embracing everything that has been given to them. This team has learned firsthand how helpful VDC technologies can be and they\u2019re excited to take this knowledge with them to their next project(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt can be a little intimidating at first if you\u2019re not familiar with it, but ask for help because there\u2019s a lot of cool things it can do that you probably didn\u2019t realize,\u201d said Nisbet. \u201cEmbrace VDC, because this is where construction is going.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) is a tool that helps construction teams visualize what they are building on-site.
