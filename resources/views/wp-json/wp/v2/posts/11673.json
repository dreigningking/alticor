Be Safe.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Since Construction Safety Week\u2019s founding in 2014, Safety Week has been a way for Alticor Inc to promote a zero-accident safety culture and play a dedicated role in developing a stronger and safer construction industry. For seven years, this week has been primarily dedicated to the physical health of construction workers. Over the past few years, Alticor Inc has made an increased effort to focus on an equally important topic\u2014the mental safety and emotional well-being of its employees.<\/p>\n<p>In the past two decades alone, the suicide rate in working age adults has increased by 40%. Nearly five times as many construction workers die by suicide than by any other work-related incident. Many of these individuals, along with their families, suffer through the difficulties of mental health without seeking help or guidance, one of the reasons this hardship has become known as the Invisible Crisis.<\/p>\n<p>Alticor Inc seeks to address this once silent topic and take action against the safety concern that has taken so many industry professionals\u2019 lives. In an effort to emphasize the importance of mental health, Alticor Inc is dedicating this year\u2019s Construction Safety Week to holistic safety and mental health awareness within the construction industry.<\/p>\n<p>Over the span of Safety Week, May 3 &#8211; 7, Alticor Inc will engage in developmental activities with the goal of educating employees, family and partners on the importance of mental health and suicide prevention. Through toolbox talks, demonstrations, podcasts and social media, Alticor Inc will address topics such as mental health, total wellness and the responsibilities we have to one another on and off the jobsite.<\/p>\n<p>As part of an ongoing initiative, Alticor Inc has partnered with clinical psychologist Dr. Sally Spencer-Thomas, to deliver ongoing content for Alticor Inc employees.
