The four-story, 71,000 SF building houses office space for a variety of County departments, with the new Board Assembly Chamber located on the first floor. The second floor serves as the employee entrance with the three upper floors being comprised of offices, workstations, interview rooms, and conference rooms to help provide flexible working areas, as well as a wellness room, a training room and staff lounges to provide spaces of relaxation during the workday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Contra Costa County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is a new, two-story state-of-the-art headquarters for the Contra Costa County Sherriff. The building, situated as part of a larger County complex, provides a unifying and functional flow. One of the main features and highlights of the building is the \u201cSituation Room\u201d that features a 31\u2019-10\u201d x 13\u2019-6\u201d screen at one end made up of 48 smaller screens. Another highlight is the ground level lecture hall, also a flexible space, which features a glass garage door at one end that opens to allow more seating area for presentations. Additional building features include office space, conference rooms and workstations, a kitchen, a gym, multiple outdoor balcony spaces and a BBQ setup with picnic tables.
