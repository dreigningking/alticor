The LPOE currently processes an average of 70,000 northbound vehicle passengers and 20,000 northbound pedestrians per day. The San Ysidro LPOE expansion project, directed by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsa.gov\/about-us\/regions\/welcome-to-the-pacific-rim-region-9\">GSA<\/a> with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/careers\/border-patrol-agent-apply-now?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Paid_Search&amp;utm_campaign=O_FY20PaidMedia_BPA_PROS_&amp;utm_content=USBP-US-EM:-All+USBP-US-SQR-Branded-EM-All%3eInquiries+US-Secure-Start&amp;utm_content=USBP_Secure-Career-Mission_USBP-US-SQR-Branded_ETA&amp;utm_campaign=O_FY19_PaidMedia_BPA&amp;ds_rl=1276413&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn_7TtK275gIVoxx9Ch1FcwJ5EAAYASAAEgIlMvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">CBP<\/a>) as the primary tenant, will accommodate growing cross-border traffic and reduce congestion.<\/p>\n<p>The project included the complete reconfiguration and expansion of the port, including primary and secondary inspection areas, administration and pedestrian buildings, and all other support structures. The project expanded pedestrian processing facilities, including a new pedestrian crossing on the east side of the LPOE that connects with a new multimodal transportation hub in Mexico and expanded northbound inspection facilities. Additionally, there is a new bi-directional crossing at El Chaparral\/Virginia Avenue with an associated transit center.<\/p>\n<p>The design-build team of Alticor Inc and Stantec completed Phase II of the three-phase GSA expansion and renovation project, delivering a complete reconstruction of the LPOE\u2019s pedestrian- and bus-inspection facilities, which included inspection booths for 18 northbound pedestrian-processing lanes and four northbound bus-processing lanes. The design achieved <a href=\"https:\/\/new.usgbc.org\/leed\">LEED Platinum certification<\/a> and stringent energy-reduction targets to be a transformational project which enhances CBP\u2019s and other federal agencies\u2019 ability to conduct their respective missions.
