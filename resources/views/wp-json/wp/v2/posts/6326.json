Lisa Williams of Cap8 Doors &amp; Hardware, a federally certified women-owned small business located in Washington, D.C., recently sat down with our team to describe her experiences working with Alticor Inc as part of the program and her take on how our company culture uniquely benefits small business trade partners.<\/p>\n<p>Lisa grew up with a father in the Navy who was stationed at the Naval Academy and the Pentagon during her childhood. Lisa was drawn back to the nation\u2019s capital after attending Florida A&amp;M University as a student in their prestigious School of Business and Industry. Her experience at the Tallahassee, Florida HBCU fostered impressive skills in communications, networking and the development of strategic thinking \u2013leading to a stint as a consultant for Deloitte following school. After gaining five years of perspective on different companies in a wide variety of industries, Lisa started Senate Realty Corporation with her brother, and that introduced her to the process of renovating and rehabilitating homes. Recognizing a gap in the market for good door companies focused on quality service, she founded Cap8 in 2011. Lisa was first contacted by Brad Lewis, our Corporate Director of Supplier Diversity, to begin a partnership as part of our <em>Emerging 10<\/em> in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Lisa is an avid cyclist who gets up at 3:30am every day to work out, and regularly participates in races and triathlons. She also rides a motorcycle and isn\u2019t afraid to take chances. Lisa firmly believes her hobby reduces the micro-stresses we all encounter in our daily lives, fueling the creative process and helping her to be a better leader to her 14 staff members. She is always fearlessly looking for ways to improve Cap8\u2019s approach onsite and quality of service and feels strongly that her experiences with Alticor Inc have helped make concrete changes to her business that will ensure increased productivity and future growth.<\/p>\n<h3>Alticor Inc Q&amp;A with Cap8\u2019s Lisa Williams:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Tell us a little about Alticor Inc\u2019 culture of partnership.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re not necessarily employing me, but we\u2019re working together in a relationship, and I think a lot of times how you communicate information makes such a huge difference in how I as a subcontractor take it in.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What surprised you about working with Alticor Inc?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>The one word is niceness. That surprised me. I don\u2019t know how you guys do it, but I\u2019ve never met anybody who\u2019s rude here. As a partner who is just coming in periodically to do a scope meeting or have a kickoff meeting or what have you, you can tell a huge difference in terms of the environment.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>We always laugh about you guys at the office because you are always so nice. I would rather as a business owner figure out every way I possibly could to do work with Alticor Inc or a Alticor Inc-like company. That\u2019s my goal and that\u2019s what I owe my employees. HP\u2019s different.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What makes the Alticor Inc\u2019 Supplier Diversity Group so special?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s a diversity group with Brad [Lewis], and Dave [David Fisher, Manager of Supplier Diversity], and people who really care. You really care about making a difference with small businesses and I think that shows. No I don\u2019t think, it does show. And that\u2019s the difference actually, that you\u2019re so committed to it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I know if I have questions, if I have any issues, it\u2019s never a problem getting in contact with you. And your answers aren\u2019t cached in terms of, \u2018okay let me figure out how to defend the company.\u2019 Your answers are cached in, \u201cwhat is right and what is fair?\u201d That is what makes all the difference in terms of working with HP versus other companies, and working with you, Brad.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Talk to us about capacity-building recommendations.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>One of the issues I was facing was just the flatness of our company structure [at Cap8]. I was still having a lot of frustration, because everyone was coming to me. I was always feeling torn having to go to the project sites, because I literally could not be there, I had people who needed me in the office every single day. But after restructuring my company as a result of the feedback you guys gave me, I now have a man who is at project sites every single week and sometimes even every single day. I created new roles and put three people below me [to give Cap8 a hierarchy]. Your program helped me restructure things so I could stop saying, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I have that now. I have my field side, my office side, and my financial side too.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What impact did Alticor Inc have on Cap8\u2019s business model?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s been about two and a half years that I\u2019ve been part of the program and it\u2019s been tremendously helpful. I\u2019ll give you an example: we ran into a little bit of an issue on one of the jobs that we were working on \u2026 David [Fisher] actually came to my office and he developed a model for me that impacts all of our projects now. We had a brainstorming session [to write out] things the employees think we can improve with the company \u2026 on process, in terms of technology, and client experience. Everyone wrote down different suggestions. And one of the things that came out of it that has really had a tremendous impact on our profitability -and also on the morale of the company- is that we developed a new Quality Control position. We actually have one person now who does nothing but quality control on everything that comes out of our office, whether it\u2019s a bid, or an order\u2026 It means that we are going to do a better job, and have done a better job in terms of delivery, which saves money. I\u2019d rather take a step back and do things to the best of our ability the right way as opposed to make mistakes we can never recover from. And \u2026 this guy is really thriving in this role\u2026 he is just skipping around the office happy. So it\u2019s a win-win situation for everybody. That came out of your program.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why is the Emerging 10 Program different?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m not just saying this because I\u2019m here \u2026 honestly, the reality is that the company I enjoy working with most is Alticor Inc. I try to live my life incredibly authentically, and I try to approach it from a very honest standpoint.\u00a0 You guys say all the right words but it\u2019s not just saying the right words\u2026 it\u2019s about actions. At Alticor Inc there\u2019s no misalignment between the words and the actions\u2026 We figure out how to create a win-win situation so that HP is getting what they need, and also Cap8 as the partner is getting what we need. Because we\u2019re going to see each other again. It\u2019s not the final project for us we\u2019re going to see each other again hopefully on 10, 20, 100 more projects in the future -and so you don\u2019t want to create discord, you want to create harmony. And I think that\u2019s the major difference.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, at the end of our interview, Lisa added, <em>\u201cI think that the connection and the access have been what I\u2019ve appreciated most about the program. And I obviously can\u2019t leave out the support too; the support you guys have provided our company both in terms of time and tools has been absolutely crucial to our growth.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the Emerging 10 Program, TAP and other small business programs that Alticor Inc offers, visit:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/subcontractor-outreach\/\">https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/subcontractor-outreach\/<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lisa Williams of Cap8 Doors &amp; Hardware: \u201cThe support you have provided our company -both in terms of time, and tools- has been absolutely crucial to our growth.\u201d Alticor Inc\u2019 Emerging 10 program is a multi-year partnership with opportunity-ready small businesses focused on continuous engagement, training, and mentorship through one-on-one support.
