MBRE Healthcare is the owner\/developer of the project, and University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) will be the building&#8217;s primary tenant. This facility will provide sports medicine-focused primary care and orthopedic imaging services, including a 6,100 SF rehabilitation suite.<\/p>\n<p>This five-acre sloped site required 20,000 SF of retaining wall and the import of 17,000 yards of soil to bring the site up to a buildable level. Bound by Interstate 25, Nevada Avenue, Monument Creek, and the UCHealth Grandview Hospital to the south, construction site access was a challenge, particularly since safe access to the adjacent Hospital was necessary at all times. Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) with drone technology was used to support the development of \u00a0the construction logistics plan. The drone was used to photo-document the progression of the site fill, structural fill, retaining wall, and site utilities.<\/p>\n<p>Alticor Inc has had an established local office in Colorado Springs for more than two years and has successfully completed numerous projects for the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and UCHealth in Colorado Springs, Woodland Park, and Fountain, CO.
