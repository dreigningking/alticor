The easy solution isn\u2019t always the excellent solution. I think about that moment and have faith in those words to this day. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How has Alticor Inc supported you throughout your career? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Alticor Inc is unlike any other company I\u2019ve witnessed; there is a true feel that the people around you become family. Any team, any job, any region are unique but alike in their dedication to their people. The teams I have been a part of have spared no effort to ensure every person has what they need to have a successful life, both at work and at home. My advice is if you are struggling, let someone know. Everyone has challenges, and in my experience encouragement and support can always be found amongst your team.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice can you give young women entering the AEC industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Being a minority in any industry isn\u2019t a handicap, it\u2019s an opportunity. Be proud of your individuality and use your unique strengths to your advantage. People will always be respected where respect is deserved. You\u2019re the only person who can limit your capacity to excel. And always know that there is an ever-growing group of accomplished women in this industry who will offer support and guidance whenever necessary.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does &#8220;Delivering EXCELLENCE in all we do.&#8221; mean to you? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>To me, Excellence is a rare quality, one that requires you constantly work toward it. It means showing up, taking action, being dynamically committed to the right solution, having the urgency to adapt and hold up your team. Excellence is an outcome of dedication, detail, and determination working harmoniously. If you find it, hold onto it, deliver it, teach it, and be willing to grow and change with it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Alticor Inc&#8217; commitment to Diversity and Inclusion, visit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/employee-diversity\/\">https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/employee-diversity\/\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Project Manager Callie Hepler joined the Alticor Inc family over 10 years ago and has spent eight years in the Southeast District.
