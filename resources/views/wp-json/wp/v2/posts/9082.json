The 197,000 SF tower will add 106 private patient rooms; six large operating rooms, including the South Bay&#8217;s only hybrid room, which allows for advanced surgical and imaging procedures in the same room; a panoramic rooftop caf\u00e9 and many more services designed to meet the needs of San Diego&#8217;s fastest-growing region.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal has always been to provide the people of the South Bay with the latest in proven medical technology along with compassionate experts who provide the excellence of care that defines Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center,&#8221; says Pablo Velez, PhD, RN, Chief Executive Officer of Sharp Chula Vista. &#8220;The opening of the new tower is our way of continuing to ensure that world-class care will always be close to home for the entire community.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The project is Sharp HealthCare&#8217;s largest single investment to date and the South Bay&#8217;s first new hospital in more than 40 years. It was funded through philanthropic donations to Sharp HealthCare Foundation, bonds, cash reserves, and the Medi-Cal hospital fee program. The design-build\u00a0team for the project included Alticor Inc, SmithGroup, and AVRP Studios.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The new hospital tower at Sharp Chula Vista is one of the safest hospitals in the world,&#8221; says Damian Buessing, Vice President and District Manager at Alticor Inc. &#8220;Embracing Sharp HealthCare&#8217;s high-reliability standards, our construction design strategies provided the safest and cleanest environment where Sharp Chula Vista employees can work, where physicians can practice medicine, and patients can receive care.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.planetree.org\/\">Planetree-Designated<\/a> hospital since 2014, the new tower includes a sweeping new main entrance and lobby and additional space for support services, including pharmacy and kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our design was inspired by the new tower&#8217;s location, perched high on a hillside overlooking San Diego and the Pacific beyond,&#8221; says Bonnie Khang-Keating, director of SmithGroup&#8217;s San Diego and Los Angeles offices. &#8220;The Ocean View Tower at Sharp Chula Vista exemplifies its community in an accessible, transparent design that evokes a feeling of refuge and healing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Explore more photos of Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/9rlykpihlfvy0kj\/AAAb-8Footjr7qoAFcr4HGopa?dl=0\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharp.com\/about\/\">Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center<\/a> is a 343-bed hospital with the largest array of health care services in San Diego&#8217;s South Bay.
