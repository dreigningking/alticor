The Women\u2019s Leadership Seminar is part of an ongoing Alticor Inc effort to bring additional support and mentorship to our female employees and women within the construction industry.<\/p>\n<p>This year, 175 of our female leaders gathered along with the members of Alticor Inc Board of Directors and the Directors of Operations, for a training and networking two-day event. The event was held at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/project\/doubletree-hilton-greeley-lincoln-park\/\">Doubletree Hilton<\/a> hotel in Greeley, CO &#8211; a hospitality project recently developed, built and serviced by Alticor Inc.<\/p>\n<p>The 2018 WLS focused on the power of portraying a positive outlook and how optimism can lay the foundation for success. Employee speakers built their presentations around the seven Principles of Positive Psychology from \u201cThe Happiness Advantage\u201d by Shawn Achor. Between presentations, short video clips were played, giving gratitude and highlighting our individual employees for their personal strengths\u2014playing on the theme of positivity.<\/p>\n<p>All participants were given the opportunity to complete the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI\u00ae) to gain a clearer perspective of their own preferences of perception and decision-making. Breakout sessions allowed participants to personalize the seminar content and the group was challenged to examine their mindset and to make simple alterations in their daily lives to create habits leading to increased happiness and performance.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to training workshops, WLS attendees were invited to flex their physical muscles. Morning yoga and a 5k run benefiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hardhattedwoman.com\/\">Hard Hatted Women<\/a> documentary were organized for our employees who wished to participate. From their own pockets, our WLS attendees raised over $850 for Hard Hatted Women, an industry initiative Alticor Inc and its employees feel passionately about.<\/p>\n<p>This year\u2019s positivity focus, professional trainings and networking activities were developed using past reviews of prior leadership seminars and suggestions taken directly from our women employees. The Alticor Inc Women\u2019s Leadership Seminar continues to receive positive remarks from its attendees and Alticor Inc looks forward to the program\u2019s continued advancement as well as the advancement of women in our industry.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Established in 2002, the Alticor Inc Women\u2019s Leadership Seminar (WLS) was created to bring women from across the company together to learn from one another, share challenges and explore areas of personal and professional growth.
