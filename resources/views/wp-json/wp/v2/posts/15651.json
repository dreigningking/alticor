Knowing she could run the business side of AAD, Mari and her husband combined their skill sets and launched the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI had to change my mindset to what if it does work, what if I do get it right, what if the right people come into my life,\u201d said Mari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her hard work and determination continue to pay off, as Mari received the William D. Bradford Minority Business of the Year Award at the 2022 University of Washington Impact Awards. Her inspiring story takes us through the twists and turns of her transition from being a schoolteacher to taking a chance on herself and becoming an award-winning businesswoman.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-building-american-abatement-demo-through-mentorship-and-community\">Building American Abatement &amp; Demo Through Mentorship and Community<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In June of 2017, she decided to leave her teaching position to work on building American Abatement &amp; Demo (AAD) full-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know construction five years ago. I took every course offered to me, invested in myself, reached out to people and built a system around me,\u201d said Mari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She went beyond just going to class to get certifications and surrounded herself with strong mentors that she could learn from, creating a support system around her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cResearch says that in order for kids to read, they need five caring adults in their lives that read to them, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any different when you\u2019re an adult. You need to have those five different people in your life who invest in you and are your mentors.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alticor Inc and Mari first met at a National Association of Minority Contractors (NAMC) Washington event in 2018. Mari was encouraged to bid on Alticor Inc\u2019 Seattle Public Schools Queen Anne Elementary School Addition where she successfully received a $50,000 contract for demolition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was AAD\u2019s first contract with a large general contractor and their first major commercial project. The Alticor Inc project team and Mari worked together to compile submittals, safety plans and cash flow projections. The team had a series of site walks and planning discussions that enabled AAD to successfully complete its first large project and first Seattle Public Schools project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:49% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/aad-workers_photo_straightened-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15652 size-full\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/aad-workers_photo_straightened-768x1024.jpeg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/aad-workers_photo_straightened-225x300.jpeg 225w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/aad-workers_photo_straightened-300x400.jpeg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/aad-workers_photo_straightened-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/aad-workers_photo_straightened-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/aad-workers_photo_straightened-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Mari describes Alticor Inc as being intentional and involved in their mentorship. This helped them to build trust with one another, furthering their relationship and partnering potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAlticor Inc has never made me feel like I can\u2019t ask for help, it has always been a safe and trusting relationship,\u201d said Mari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When presented with a challenge as she started her business, Mari looked to her mentors and support system around her for guidance. She knew she had to take the proper steps to legitimize AAD and take it to the next level. Alticor Inc&#8217; Vice President and District Manager Shannon Gustine and Operations Manager Dave Hutt have served as mentors to Mari, helping her to navigate the challenges of a growing business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI really needed to make sure that I ran a business that\u2019s legit. There are standards and procedures I originally didn\u2019t realize were there since we were just a mom-and-pop shop,\u201d said Mari. \u201cIf you want to play in the game, you\u2019ve got to know the rules.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Head Start Program is an exclusive program brokered through The Barbour Group that supports subcontractors who need financial assistance, are first time bond users or need more bonding capacity. The goals of the program include increasing participation of qualified small businesses on Alticor Inc projects and helping small businesses reach their long-term goals. In October of 2020, Mari met with Alticor Inc to utilize the Head Start Program\u2019s services and has since increased AAD\u2019s bonding capacity to over $1 million.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her mentorship with Dave Hutt has helped her to navigate past roadblocks and take more tasks into her own hands, helping to put things back on her schedule.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hutt also provided Mari with advice and assistance when a waste management company could not take debris containers when she needed them to, resulting in a delay of schedule. Instead of waiting for the waste management companies and with help from Hutt, she was able to get her own cans and is now able to handle waste removal on her own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[Alticor Inc] is able to bring a lens of different solutions that I am not aware of because I haven\u2019t been in this industry forever.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"270\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DebrisBinTrio-1-1024x270.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15694\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DebrisBinTrio-1-1024x270.jpg 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DebrisBinTrio-1-300x79.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DebrisBinTrio-1-768x202.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DebrisBinTrio-1.jpg 1155w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Mari purchased her own debris containers after facing challenges coordinating with waste management companies, which has given her more control over her project schedules.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-3 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 33%\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Mari-Dave-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15687 size-full\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Mari-Dave-copy.jpg 540w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Mari-Dave-copy-225x300.jpg 225w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Mari-Dave-copy-300x400.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h4 id=\"h-developing-herself-while-growing-a-business\">Developing Herself While Growing a Business<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2018, Alticor Inc had the opportunity to support a business\u2019 participation in the University of Washington (UW) Foster School of Business &#8211; Ascend Business Growth Program, which provides business owners with the ability to learn proven business practices. Alticor Inc immediately thought of Mari, and she took full advantage of the opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She not only graduated from the program but also received a full scholarship to the UW Minority Business Executive Program. In addition, Mari was selected for the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative. She completed both programs with excellence and has applied what she learned to her business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mari not only expanded her knowledge of the services the program offered but quickly experienced rapid growth as a business owner and a leader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSomething that I learned was as time goes by you have to trust that the people you are putting in place can do their jobs without you micromanaging them.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Serving Her Community Beyond the Scope of Work<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Mari has a mindset that she can make a difference and an impact on her community beyond the physical work performed by AAD. She\u2019s more than just an employer to those who work for her, but a mentor who looks for ways to help develop their careers and guide them throughout their time with AAD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she first started AAD, Mari had a focus on providing jobs to people who had previously been incarcerated. She recognized the challenges they experience and wanted to help them get back on their feet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI built a business oriented in helping those that were previously incarcerated by helping them find a job they can feed their families with.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In more recent years, she has created a partnership with Boys and Girls Club to provide older members with internships so that she can mentor and introduce them to construction. If the internship goes well, she can then offer them a full-time job and help them kickstart their career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mari is deeply connected to the larger scale impact she has had on people\u2019s lives. She became emotional as she reflected on one of her current employees who joined her from the Boys and Girls Club partnership. She comments that while it has not only has it been amazing to see his growth at work and the various milestones he has reached, she knows the stable job is going a long way for his family as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTo scale it back a little bit more, he\u2019s got two little boys at home. What are you doing for those kids\u2019 dad when he gets home? It makes me cry, because that is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d said Mari. \u201cWhen Alticor Inc gives us contracts it goes way beyond just the contract.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making an impact in others&#8217; lives is what Mari is most passionate about, and she uses the resources and opportunities she now has to give back and help others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:45% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/AAD-Truck-Employees-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15689 size-full\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/AAD-Truck-Employees-1024x768.jpg 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/AAD-Truck-Employees-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/AAD-Truck-Employees-768x576.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/AAD-Truck-Employees-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/AAD-Truck-Employees-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>\u201cHow I have made people feel while they\u2019re here and taking the time to help people get to their next best self is what will last after I\u2019m gone.

LPOE was her first federal contract, and Alticor Inc helped her navigate the stringent project requirements while working on an active border crossing. It was her first contract to span multiple months and taught her how to manage her cash flow in order to float the project for three months. This project paved the way for Mari to join the 8(a) Business Development Program through the U.S. Small Business Administration, broadening her opportunities nationwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, Mari is looking to expand AAD to Texas so that she can be closer to her family. Once there, she hopes to scale up her program with McKinstry and will take a class with Goldman Sachs to help work out the details of her Texas expansion. She will continue her partnership with Alticor Inc both in Seattle and Texas.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>American Abatement &amp; Demo (AAD) CEO and President Mari Borrero has worked hard to build AAD and create her reputation as a construction executive from the ground up.
