The team fabricated this 78-foot, 60,000-pound structure in the shop and shipped side trusses as whole pieces. The bridge structure was engineered and fabricated with approximately nine inches of camber, and assembled on the ground and decked prior to erection. This set up process took about six hours overall, rigging and demobilization and about two and a half hours to pick the bridge and set it in place. The highly technical operation took place at night and required coordination with the City of Puyallup for a road closure, with BNSF for a railroad flagger and with Puget Sound Energy for a spotter and de-energization of the overhead transmission lines. The result was a safe operation that was completed according to plan, and installation of the new pedestrian bridge on the project. The project provides a new, 171,000 SF, five-level, 510-space parking garage and expands the existing surface lot to accommodate 167-spaces.
