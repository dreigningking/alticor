As a large contractor with over 80 years of proven success in our field, it is our responsibility to ensure that smaller trade partners have the same opportunities for growth and success.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to our proprietary outreach programs, Alticor Inc participates in locally assembled mentorship programs. These Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Programs allow small businesses to partner with Alticor Inc, providing them with strategic navigation, industry education, business development and overall guidance to help them grow and further develop their business.<\/p>\n<p>Alticor Inc&#8217; active participation with the City and County of Denver&#8217;s Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program has allowed Alticor Inc to foster and promote <a href=\"http:\/\/skybluebuilders.com\/\">Sky Blue Builders<\/a>, a SBE\/MWBE business mentored by Alticor Inc since 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Sky Blue Builders focuses their expertise on design-build, tenant finish, infrastructure, and on-call\/IDIQ projects, as well as self-performing concrete and carpentry, primarily in Colorado and New Mexico. As a General Contractor, Alticor Inc helps Sky Blue Builders navigate the construction industry by assisting their team with the development and review of their sales and business plans, peer reviews, assessing staffing resources, and communicating known opportunities. Based on these business needs, this guidance comes directly from the Alticor Inc\u2019 operations, estimating, and project development teams.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-7783\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Glen-Mary-Brown-Glen-Mar-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Glen-Mary-Brown-Glen-Mar-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Glen-Mary-Brown-Glen-Mar-768x576.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Glen-Mary-Brown-Glen-Mar-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>In 2018, Alticor Inc, in collaboration with SBA\u2019s All Small Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program (ASMPP), has worked alongside <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glenmarconstruction.com\/glenmar\/pages\/index.php\">Glen\/Mar Construction Inc.<\/a>, a SDVOSB woman-owned small business that provides construction management services to the federal government. Glen\/Mar enrolled into the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program with the goal to enter new markets, engage new customers and manage\u00a0their revenue ceiling. The joint venture between Glen\/Mar and Alticor Inc has allowed Glen\/Mar to seek larger opportunities in Washington, California, Hawaii and Guam. Currently, Glen\/Mar is providing support on our P601 Maintenance Aircraft Hangar project in Guam.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTwo important tenants of our culture that were immediately present within Alticor Inc was a commitment to \u201cplay fair\u201d and \u201crisk wisely,\u201d both internally and externally with partners, subcontractors, and client. This was really an important factor for Glen\/Mar. Alticor Inc is as highly regarded as any firm in the construction industry and we believe they can help us expand, add, refine our processes to help us increase our capacity and capability to perform larger, more complex projects, as well as manage growth wisely and expand geographically,\u201d said Mary Brown, President and Co-owner of Glen\/Mar.<\/p>\n<p>By creating these mentorship partnerships, companies like Sky Blue Builders and Glen\/Mar bring Alticor Inc an awareness of small business needs and the challenges involved in working with larger companies like our own. This collaboration provides Alticor Inc with the understanding and opportunity to adapt and change processes to help support the small business community.<\/p>\n<p>Alticor Inc will continue to support small businesses and programs like the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. It is our culture and our business to foster these growing trade partners\u2014doing our part to ensure sustainable growth for our industry.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For over twenty-five years, Alticor Inc has been dedicated to small business outreach and achieving the highest level of diverse business inclusion on every one of our projects.
