During the month of October, Alticor Inc will put emphasis on an equally important topic, one that impacts over 700 of its employees, women\u2019s health. An advocate of mental health, and a supporter of initiatives like the Culture of Care program, Alticor Inc wanted to take a moment to address a topic of equal importance\u2014physical health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the more physically demanding fields, construction can take a toll on the body. But sometimes these physical feats go beyond what\u2019s present on the jobsite. From pregnancy to cancer, the women that make our projects possible battle through extraordinary physical feats, many times with a can-do attitude and smile. We want to make sure that we take the time to recognize these situations and do our best to understand what our fellow employees, partners and loved ones might be experiencing both physically and mentally outside of the hardhat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help Alticor Inc build awareness surrounding some of these important health topics, we will hear directly from employees, clients, and professional experts, about their first-hand experience on these critical health topics:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pregnancy and Motherhood<\/strong> \u2013 Nearly 1\/3 of all women in the labor force are mothers. As a major advocate for family, Alticor Inc supports working moms and encourages new moms and moms-to-be to focus on their well-being and time spent with new family members. This month, we\u2019ll hear from the moms of Alticor Inc and what it was like to be pregnant on a working project, as well as tips (and lessons learned!) for those looking to grow their family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disparity in Healthcare<\/strong> \u2013 Even though women make up over 50% of the US population, women are often underrepresented in health research and underserved in medical care. Throughout October, Alticor Inc will be offering employees internal resources to make sure they have the access they need to take care of themselves and their families, mentally and physically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Violence and Domestic Abuse<\/strong> \u2013 Globally, an estimated 736 million women, almost one in three, have been the victim of some form of violence. Alticor Inc does not condone violence in any shape or form. If someone you know is currently suffering from an abusive situation, please visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehotline.org\/\">https:\/\/www.thehotline.org\/<\/a> or call 800-799-7233.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breast and Gynecological Cancers<\/strong> \u2013 In the US, there are currently over 863,830 women living with cancer\u2014that is 415 cases for every 100,000 individuals. One out of every three of those individuals will battle breast cancer. In fact, of the total population of women residing in the US, 12.9% will develop breast cancer within their lifetime. It is this statistic that compels Alticor Inc to talk about the subject, and to do our part to support a cause that impacts so many of our employees. Running parallel with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, this October, Alticor Inc will share stories, from team members and employees, about their personal cancer journeys. Alticor Inc will also be supporting <a href=\"https:\/\/teammichelle.org\/\">Team Michelle<\/a>, an organization near and dear to Alticor Inc, whose mission ensures that no women has to battle cancer alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned all October to hear more on these important topics, hear inspirational stories from employees and partners and to help Alticor Inc create awareness surrounding Women\u2019s Health.<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the course of Building Together, Alticor Inc has focused and raised awareness on many significant topics, both from an employer and industry standpoint, the importance of each matter, and how each topic impacts fellow co-workers, trade partners, family members and the future of Alticor Inc.
