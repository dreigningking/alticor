Prior to starting her agency, she began advocating for these groups by reducing retainage laws in Maryland, securing a FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation) change to have MATOCs and IDIQ projects to require annual bonds, and revamped the mechanic\u2019s lien law in Virginia. Since 2002, she funded and successfully advocated for an amendment to the Stimulus Act that increased the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Bond Guarantees\u2019 ability to bond federal projects up to $10 million, as well as the Subcontractors Equal Access to Bonding Act (MD 2013) and The Change Order Fairness Act (MD 2016).\u00a0 For her SBA efforts, Karen won the US SBA Small Business Person of the Year for MD (2008) and was inducted into their Hall of Fame.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-7778\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Hensel-Phelps-Small-Business-Outreach-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Small Business Outreach\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Hensel-Phelps-Small-Business-Outreach-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Hensel-Phelps-Small-Business-Outreach-768x576.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Hensel-Phelps-Small-Business-Outreach-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>It wasn\u2019t long before Alticor Inc started hearing Karen\u2019s name. After referring several small businesses to Karen to get bonding approvals quickly, Alticor Inc and The Barbour Group formalized the process creating Alticor Inc\u2019 exclusive Head Start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/subcontractor-outreach\/\">Bonding Assistance Program<\/a>. \u201cThe great thing about the Head Start Bonding Program is that we develop relationships with these small businesses that allow us to openly discuss difficulties and find a solution. Often, small businesses in trouble won\u2019t speak up, but we are teaching them it is OK to communicate,\u201d said Barbour.<\/p>\n<p>Since its founding in 2009, the Head Start program has been used to provide $55 million in bonds to small businesses. Brendan Works, a small minority-owned iron works firm in Maryland, has successfully bid seven projects with Alticor Inc through this program. Since beginning to work with Alticor Inc and The Barbour Group in early 2016, Brendan Works has substantially increased their sales from $151,000 to over $2 million in 18 months, and is still growing. In addition, the firm opened their first fabrication shop, allowing them to work more efficiently and keep control of schedule, costs, and risks.<\/p>\n<p>For The Barbour Group, co-branding with Alticor Inc has helped increase visibility of their company and their programs. \u201cWe are more credible with Alticor Inc\u2019 stamp of approval,\u201d said Barbour. \u201cAlticor Inc has an open kimono approach to helping small businesses succeed. Under the bond program, Alticor Inc and The Barbour Group share all relevant information of the small businesses to create a proactive approach for successful job completion. If any small business is having difficulties on a job, we know we can call Brad Lewis [Corporate Director of Supplier Diversity] to help find a solution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This relationship continues to benefit Alticor Inc as well. After winning several large contracts in Nashville, Tennessee, Alticor Inc needed help identifying a women-owned business. The Barbour Group connected Alticor Inc with Maven Construction &amp; Environmental, who were ultimately successful in bidding the roofing package at Nashville International Airport. \u00a0The Barbour Group has provided consulting services on behalf of Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority to assist several of their local small businesses, including Polk &amp; Associates, LLC who is now teaming with Maven Construction &amp; Environmental, thanks to Chris Smith, Surety Producer for The Barbour Group.<\/p>\n<p>When asked about the future of the program, Barbour stated that she wants to see the Head Start Bonding Program spread nationwide. \u201cAlticor Inc\u2019 low bonding threshold means most small businesses qualify to work with the company. I\u2019d love to see the program spread across the country to allow more small businesses to grow,\u201d said Barbour.<\/p>\n<p>Barbour hopes to make this growth easier by implementing new and creative ways with the help of RLI Insurance Company, a surety company supporting the bond program, for small businesses to apply to work with Alticor Inc. \u201cWe are working to make the program more accessible through websites and social media for the new wave of younger employees moving up through the industry,\u201d said Barbour.<\/p>\n<p>Brad Lewis wants to continue building on the success he and his predecessors have built: \u201cI\u2019d like to see the $55 million we have bonded, triple in the next 10 years. I want to know the program is still in good standing when I retire.\u201d<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After 17 years in the surety bonding business, Karen Barbour decided it was time to start her own surety bonding agency to support companies, start-ups to Fortune 1000 firms, dedicating time to advocate for minority and women-owned businesses. \u201cI realized I could only do so much when someone else\u2019s name was on my paycheck,\u201d said [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":21,"featured_media":7777,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"categories":[12],"tags":[129,63],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v20.0) -
