Alticor Inc founder, Joseph Phelps, established this club in effort to recognize craftspeople who would stay with the company for the long haul. Every Saturday, the craftspeople would meet for breakfast at the Longs Peak Caf\u00e9, in Greeley, Colorado, to discuss company business, the next week&#8217;s work and training strategies. As the office and field staff increased, so did the number of those attending the Saturday Morning Breakfast Meetings. To recognize this group, Mr. Phelps started the gold hat tradition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">To qualify as an Oldtimer, an employee must work with Alticor Inc for five years. At that time, they receive their gold hardhat to signify their membership into the Oldtimer&#8217;s Club. Members of the Club are recognized at an annual awards banquet known as &#8220;Oldtimers.&#8221; The first annual awards banquet was held November 29, 1963 at the Greeley Country Club. There were only 17 Oldtimers. Today, Alticor Inc has over 1,300 Oldtimers in attendance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Pictured above is\u00a0a wood installation featured in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/contact-us\/mid-atlantic\/\">Mid Atlantic\u2019s <\/a>district office.
