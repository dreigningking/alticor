One hundred percent of the money raised by participants goes directly to early phase studies and clinical trials. These funds are a powerful source of flexible support. In 2019, more than 2,800 participants contributed $635,000 to cancer center research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the life of the event, proceeds have enabled progress on more than three dozen research projects, each one expanding our understanding of cancer in its many forms. When you stop at nothing to make a difference, this is where the end of cancer begins.
