Justin has spent the past 20 years working alongside Kirk and is eager to continue his legacy for growth and success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have picked a better person to succeed me,\u201d said Kirk. \u201cThe Starnes family has moved fourteen times in the past twenty years supporting our operational staffs through three districts. His and his family\u2019s dedication to Alticor Inc is unmatched. He will lead the district to greater heights.\u201d<\/em><br><br>Some of Alticor Inc\u2019 most notable work in the Southeast includes the recently completed South Terminal C Airside project in Orlando, Florida, the Navy Federal Credit Union Campus Expansion in Pensacola, Florida, and the up-and-coming Zone 1 F-35 Flightline Facilities at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. All three have been the district\u2019s largest project awards to date at a total of $1.8 billion. Moving into 2023, the Southeast district will focus on growth and expansion with new clients and markets, while continuing to grow our longstanding relationships with our repeat clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI want to thank Kirk for his 20 plus years of mentorship he has provided me,\u201d said Justin. \u201cKirk is not just a great coworker but has become a close friend over the years. Kirk has chosen to step away at the top of his career in a very humble fashion. He could not have done it in a better way.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please join Alticor Inc in thanking Kirk Hazen for his 32-years of distinguished service and wish him well in retirement.
