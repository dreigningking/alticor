After starting her career in estimating, Anna excelled within Alticor Inc\u2019 operational procedures on the region\u2019s first K-12 project, Seattle Public Schools\u2019 Queen Anne Elementary School Addition. Shortly after, Anna took her attention to detail and strong communication skills to Sound Transit\u2019s design-build Operations and Maintenance Facility East, where she developed a commissioning plan to support the project\u2019s completion. Anna continues to trailblaze and is now focused on starting-up Alticor Inc&#8217; first progressive design-build project in the Pacific Northwest on the University of Washington\u2019s Interdisciplinary Engineering Building.<\/p>\n<h4>Alticor Inc Q&amp;A with Anna Cummins:<\/h4>\n<p>Name: Anna Cummins<br \/>\nTitle:\u00a0Project Engineer<br \/>\nDistrict: Northern California \u2013 PNW Region<br \/>\nYears with Alticor Inc: 2.5<br \/>\nProject:\u00a0University of Washington, Interdisciplinary Engineering Building<br \/>\nFun\/Random Fact: I could eat sushi for every meal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do you love construction? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Construction is such a rewarding field of work. It allows you to be creative and innovative all while collaborating on a team to see a common goal fulfilled. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any better feeling than standing in a completed space with your team, recounting the challenges that you worked through, all while celebrating a completed project. Construction allows for so many unique voices to be heard and where individual experiences are more valuable than the standard path.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What does &#8220;Delivering EXCELLENCE in all we do.&#8221; mean to you? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Long before I began with Alticor Inc, I was taught to strive for excellence in everything you do; this mindset completely changes the way that you approach work. There\u2019s an old saying that says if something is worth being done, it is worth being done well; I think that speaks directly to who we are at Alticor Inc. You learn about the character of a person, or company, by how they complete the small, unnoticeable tasks. Our company has fostered a culture where a high level of importance is placed on being excellent in every aspect of our operations and it is noticed by our trade partners, owners, and industry colleagues. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What was the best advice you&#8217;ve received throughout your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>When I was very new in my career, I allowed myself to become worked up over a challenge I was facing which at the time, seemed detrimental to the project in my eyes. A more tenured colleague pulled me aside and allowed me to vent my frustrations. At the end, instead of providing me advice for how to move forward, he said, \u201cAnna, it will get built.\u201d That has stuck with me ever since. No matter how bad a situation looks, the team that you are surrounded with at Alticor Inc won\u2019t allow the project to fail. At the end of the day, \u2018it will get built\u2019 and you\u2019ll move on to the next opportunity, with a set of newly acquired skills and experiences.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice can you give young women entering the AEC industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>For young women entering the AEC industry, I would encourage her to focus on her goals instead of becoming bogged down by trying to fit into a stereotypical career path. As a woman, you have been given a set of wonderfully unique skills and ambitions that are different from your male counterparts. Instead of allowing those differences to be a roadblock, embrace them and utilize them to help advance the industry and your personal growth. At the end of the day, we all want the same thing, to be the best builders, designers, and problem solvers that we can be\u2014use your diversity to become those things. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Alticor Inc&#8217; commitment to Diversity and Inclusion, visit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/employee-diversity\/\">https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/employee-diversity\/\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Project Engineer Anna Cummins has been integral to Alticor Inc\u2019 success in the Pacific Northwest since joining the team in 2018.
