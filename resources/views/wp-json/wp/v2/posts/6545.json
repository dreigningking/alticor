In addition to the new concourse, the project entails\u00a0expanding the airport\u2019s ticketing lobby and baggage claim by adding 200,000 square\u00a0feet of space\u00a0to the north and south ends of the terminal. Other components of the project include remodeling 136,000 square feet of existing terminal space and building an 11,000 square foot central utility plant. The Concourse D project is set for completion in summer 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTravelers want and need more aircraft gates, more destinations, more dining and more retail as part of their BNA experience. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ll be giving them when this project is completed,\u201d said Bobby Joslin, MNAA Board of Commissioners chair. \u201cThe new Concourse D is one of many projects that comprise\u00a0BNA Vision. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the overall direction of our airport and how we are rising to the challenge.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nashville International Airport is one of the fastest growing airports in North America. In 2017, 14.1 million passengers traveled into and out of BNA, an increase of more than 1.1 million passengers, representing an 8.9 percent increase over the previous year and setting a new all-time passenger record for the fifth consecutive calendar year. Projections indicate passenger traffic at BNA will surpass 23 million by 2037.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis new Concourse D will give us more capacity for commercial air service to meet the rising demand for travel to and from Nashville,\u201d said Doug Kreulen, MNAA president and CEO. \u201cAnd we will see to it that the look and feel of this space reflects the sights and sounds, tastes and hospitality for which Music City is so well known. With multiple\u00a0BNA Vision\u00a0projects now underway, the world-class airport we\u2019re building for this world-class city is beginning to take shape. It\u2019s an exciting time, and there\u2019s much more to come.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Like our city, Nashville International Airport is growing and adapting to meet the needs of our community,&#8221; said Nashville Mayor David Briley. &#8220;Today&#8217;s groundbreaking marks a significant part of the airport&#8217;s ongoing expansion plans, and that growth is essential to our city&#8217;s continued economic success. The new and improved BNA will make Nashville an even more inviting place and benefit our region as a driver of business travel and tourism for years to come.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Take a virtual 360-degree tour, view renderings and watch the\u00a0BNA Vision video at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bnavisionnashville.com\/\">BNAvision.com.<\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After several months of design, the Nashville International Airport Concourse D and Terminal Wings Expansion project broke ground!\u00a0Joined by the Mayor of Nashville, David Briley, the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) and the Board of Commissioners, the Alticor Inc | Fentress Architects Progressive Design-Build team broke ground on Wednesday, June 20.
