City Group Solutions services include post construction cleaning, dump trucking, hauling, street sweeping, snow plowing and other construction support needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Port of Seattle\u2019s North Satellite Modernization project (NSAT) at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), City Group Solutions performed street sweeping and final cleaning beginning in November 2020 through the opening of NSAT\u2019s remaining gates in July 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to working with Alticor Inc on NSAT, City Group Solutions providing final cleaning for Alticor Inc\u2019 Sound Transit Operations and Maintenance Facility East project in Belleuve, Washington.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;NSAT has been a great experience for City Group Solutions. The entire team, Alticor Inc and Port of Seattle, was supportive from the beginning and made it clear, &#8216;we want you to succeed on this project.&#8217;\u201d Alticor Inc Area Superintendent Dustin Jewett worked closely with City Group Solutions to ensure their success on the project. He was impressed by their ability to handle the fast-paced project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Area Superintendent Dustin Jewett pulled me aside and told me that he would do whatever he could to make my project a success. He mentioned that he had pretty much worked every scope you could imagine in construction and could offer any advice or assistance that I needed. Project Engineer Connor Willey, who worked mainly in the office, assisted me on the administrative side whenever I had any questions. He made the backend process much easier for me with detailed explanations and assistance whenever I needed him.\u00a0We at City Group Solutions owe much of our success to Alticor Inc staff for believing in us to complete this project successfully. We are forever grateful.\u201d \u2013 DeChelle Henderson<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>City Group Solutions had a prior relationship with Port of Seattle DBE Program Manager Tameka Thornton. They continued to build those relationships while working with Alticor Inc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:33% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/NSAT-0007-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13278 size-full\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/NSAT-0007-1.jpg 750w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/NSAT-0007-1-225x300.jpg 225w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/NSAT-0007-1-300x400.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h4 id=\"h-how-working-on-nsat-supported-city-group-solutions-business-goals\">How Working on NSAT Supported City Group Solutions&#8217; Business Goals<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>NSAT was City Group Solutions largest project to date. DeChelle took advantage of the bonding assistance with Barbour Group to meet the bonding requirements to work on the project. Their award and subsequent success on NSAT elevated their bonding capacity and line of credit. This helped build City Group Solutions\u2019 capacity for future projects and growth. \u201cTwo years ago, I didn\u2019t see myself in this capacity at all and I didn\u2019t imagine I would be able to help so many families along the way during this pandemic.\u00a0It\u2019s truly been an amazing and fulfilling ride,&#8221; said DeChelle Henderson.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to building capacity to pursue larger projects in the future, DeChelle was able to keep her workers employed, which can be challenging with the final cleaning scope. By going directly from Alticor Inc\u2019 Sound Transit Operations and Maintenance Facility East Project to NSAT, DeChelle did not have to lay off her staff, which was especially important during the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-how-hensel-phelps-supported-city-group-solutions-during-the-project\">How Alticor Inc supported City Group Solutions During the Project<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Alticor Inc Vice President and District Manager Shannon Gustine served as an informal mentor to DeChelle. After meeting at the Port of Seattle\u2019s WMBE event, Shannon encouraged DeChelle to bid for final cleaning on the Sound Transit Operations and Maintenance Facility East. Upon winning the contract, City Group Solutions received constructive feedback and demonstrated that they could handle a project of that size. They took what they learned and moved onto NSAT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cBeing a woman in an industry dominated by so many males, it was so inspiring to see Shannon in her role.&nbsp; Meeting her really gave me the confidence to go after what I wanted with no fear.&nbsp;Shannon was the first Alticor Inc employee I met.&nbsp;I could see that under her leadership, every staff member that I met thereafter was equally inspiring, respectful, professional and helpful. They were just overall great people to work with.&nbsp;Shannon changed my family&#8217;s life, and I will forever be grateful for her taking a chance working with my small business.\u201d \u2013 DeChelle Henderson<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>DeChelle did the six-week Alticor Inc Technical Assistance Program for small businesses. This program offered her a wealth of information from safety, to project management, to bidding and estimating. Headed by David Fisher, Alticor Inc\u2019 manager of supplier diversity, she felt the program was extremely beneficial for her small businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing DeChelle\u2019s drive, Alticor Inc sponsored her participation in the University of Washington\u2019s Ascend program, which helps businesses owned by people of color, women and veterans grow through management education, loans and investments and market access. DeChelle was able to gain access to more funding through the program and combined with her experience at NSAT, she feels confident about pursuing larger contracts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/\u00a9MikkiPiper_OMFE_54-1024x730.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13269\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/\u00a9MikkiPiper_OMFE_54-1024x730.jpg 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/\u00a9MikkiPiper_OMFE_54-300x214.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/\u00a9MikkiPiper_OMFE_54-768x547.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/\u00a9MikkiPiper_OMFE_54-1536x1094.jpg 1536w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/\u00a9MikkiPiper_OMFE_54-2048x1459.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Sound Transit Operations and Maintenance Facility East in Bellevue, Washington.
