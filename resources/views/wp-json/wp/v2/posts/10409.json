This summer, JT traveled from Chicago to Hawaii for the very first time. He is currently studying Construction Management and Business Management at Eastern Illinois University.<\/p>\n<h3>Alticor Inc Q&amp;A with Jasaun Clark:<\/h3>\n<p>Name: Jasaun \u201cJT\u201d Clark<br \/>\nSchool\/Graduation Year: Eastern Illinois University \/ 2021<br \/>\nField of Study: Major in Construction Management &amp; Business Management, Minor in Engineering Technology &amp; Entrepreneurship<br \/>\nHometown: Chicago, IL<br \/>\nDistrict: Pacific<br \/>\nDepartment: Kaiser Leeward Clinic Medical Office Building, Kapolei, HI<br \/>\nFun\/Random Fact: In high school, played six different sports: football, basketball, swimming, track &amp; field, wrestling, and tennis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do you love construction?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I love construction because it is exciting to see the end product. In construction, you will rarely, if ever, find two projects that are the same. Every day is a brand new start with brand new challenges. Finishing and admiring a completed project brings me joy. I can\u2019t wait to look at a structure and say, \u201cI built that.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What made you want to go into your field of study?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>When I was in the eighth grade, I joined the engineering club because it was an excuse to get out of class. At a meeting, we built a bridge using tape and toothpicks, then we saw which bridge could carry the most load. My bridge blew everyone away! From that point on, I did my research on what I wanted to study in college, which led me to construction. I knew that I wanted to be a leader and obtain a grasp from all aspects of a project, which is why I am double majoring in Construction Management and Business Management.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your goals for this internship and your career?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>My two main goals are to build my brand and learn as much as possible. I would not be here if I did not want to work for Alticor Inc. I chose to intern for Alticor Inc because I want to be a permanent part of their team. Hopefully, I can show them why I am the best candidate for the position through my actions and eagerness to learn. I live life with the philosophy that every experience, whether good or bad, is a learning experience. I know that I do not know everything, and I probably never will. I will learn from all of my triumphs and mistakes because knowledge is power!<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>You\u2019ve traveled quite the distance for your internship. What has that experience been like for you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>The experience has been mind-blowing! I can admit that I was a little concerned about coming to Hawaii for an entire summer. I am from Chicago and I have never even been to the West Coast, let alone Hawaii. As soon as I got off the plane, that fear was gone. Hawaii is one of the most gorgeous places I have visited and the people on the islands are some of the most welcoming people I have met. Alticor Inc did a fantastic job of making me feel at home. From my first day on the jobsite, my team has been like a family to me.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Of the Five Alticor Inc Core Values (Ownership, Integrity, Builder, Diversity and Community) which means the most to you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>The one core value that has impacted me most is Alticor Inc\u2019 value of \u201ccommunity.\u201d Alticor Inc invests in their people and not just in a financial sense. From the moment I stepped onto the jobsite, I felt like I joined a new family. Everyone looks out for one another and has each other\u2019s best interests at heart. It is rare to see this level of teamwork and I am sure it has something to do with Alticor Inc being an employee-owned company.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to other students looking to work for Alticor Inc?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Stand out. The employees and interns here at Alticor Inc are some of the most unique people I have met. Everyone has their own personality and set of skills, which is why we can prosper as a team, but everyone shares a drive for excellence. Everyone here strives to be the best at what they do. My advice is to have a positive attitude and stand out.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-10411\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT1-300x200.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT1.jpg 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-10412\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT2-300x200.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT2.jpg 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-10414\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT3-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT3-300x200.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/JT3.jpg 728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jasaun \u201cJT\u201d Clark is a first-year intern with Alticor Inc and joined the Kaiser Leeward Clinic Medical Office Building project in Kapolei, Hawaii.
