It will also include a 403,000 SF outpatient treatment and support building and 381,000 SF above-grade parking structure plus a 23,000 SF facilities and IT support building and a new 24,000 SF central plant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consolidating inpatient and outpatient services into new buildings that optimize operational effectiveness, the medical center project reduces operation and maintenance costs. In addition, it provides outpatient facilities that accommodate planned patient visits, implements the county\u2019s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Development (LEED) requirements by incorporating sustainable design features and creates a campus designed for the well-being of patients and staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAdding a million square feet to an existing 70-year-old campus creates significant planning and cost challenges,\u201d HMC Architects\u2019 Healthcare Practice Leader Kirk Rose, AIA, DBIA said. \u201cOur design will optimize operational flow and throughput, arrange the program at a very efficient cost and create a beautiful new outdoor space for community enjoyment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Targeting LEED Gold certification, the medical center upgrade will develop a modern campus that serves the community\u2019s healthcare needs while also aiming to protect the environment in which it\u2019s built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cThe new Harbor-UCLA Medical Center will consolidate the patient experience around a central park, providing easy wayfinding and access to both inpatient and outpatient services through this natural center.
