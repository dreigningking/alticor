Projects at UCHealth Memorial Hospital Central, Memorial Hospital North, and Grandview Hospital include an interventional radiology suite, imaging suites, a Hybrid OR and PACU space, a central sterile suite, an outpatient clinic floor, and the addition of new emergency departments across several campuses.<\/p>\n<p>On the Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital campus at Stanford, Alticor Inc is partnering with facilities and hospital staff to build out the 5<sup>th<\/sup> floor while the hospital remains fully operational. When complete, the 5<sup>th<\/sup> floor will consist of two new bed wings, one for stem cell patients and one for oncology patients, totaling 49 patient beds, in addition to a pharmacy and support spaces.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4092\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Hensel-Phelps-Sharp-Chula-Vista-Ocean-View-Tower2-300x159.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"159\" \/>For the first time in over 40-years, San Diego\u2019s South Bay community is getting a much-needed medical hospital addition. Sharp Healthcare tapped the Alticor Inc team to construct the $190 million, 197,696 square-foot, seven-story Ocean View Tower. Connected to the existing hospital on the medical campus, the new tower features a large, light-filled lobby, 106 spacious and private patient rooms, operating rooms, Intensive Care Units (ICU) suites, medical-surgical patient rooms, central nurse stations, family waiting areas, a rooftop caf\u00e9, and indoor\/outdoor dining with panoramic ocean views.<\/p>\n<p>With more exciting healthcare projects on the horizon, Alticor Inc continues to train our field teams in the latest standards and with increasingly advanced technology.
