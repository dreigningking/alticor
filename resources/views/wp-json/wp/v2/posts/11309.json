It continuously challenges me and pushes me to grow and it stretches the boundaries of my imagination. It pushes the envelope of what is physically possible. I also love working with a diverse group of people with different backgrounds that work together for a common objective. Despite everyone\u2019s individual goals, if we collectively build the project on time and under budget, everyone wins. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How has Alticor Inc supported you throughout your career? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Alticor Inc has supported me throughout my career by pushing me out of my comfort zone, yet providing a lifeline when I need it. They have encouraged me to take on roles that challenge me mentally and emotionally, but I have never felt alone, and for that I am grateful. I\u2019ve been blessed to work with individuals that care not only about my work results, but my family and my well-being and those individuals abound in Alticor Inc. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice can you give young women entering the AEC industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I would tell young women entering the AEC industry to maintain an open mind, work hard, be thirsty for knowledge, always seek to understand the why, and share your newfound knowledge with everyone who is interested in learning. The more you can train others effectively, the better leader you can become. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Of the 5 Alticor Inc Core Values (Ownership, Integrity, Builder, Diversity and Community) \u2013 which means the most to you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Of the 5 Alticor Inc Core Values, integrity means the most to me because it builds the foundation for everything else. If you are honest and genuine, mean what you say, follow through with your word, and do the right thing, fulfilling our other core values becomes more meaningful. Growing our business with integrity is so important because as Albert Einstein said, \u201cWhoever is careless with the truth in small matters, cannot be trusted with important matters\u201d, and what we do as a company is important to our communities and to our people. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Alticor Inc&#8217; commitment to Diversity and Inclusion, visit\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/employee-diversity\/\">https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/employee-diversity\/\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" class=\"sharethis-inline-share-buttons\" ><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Area Superintendent Maria Martinez has been a key member of the Alticor Inc Northern California District for the entirety of her seven-year career.
