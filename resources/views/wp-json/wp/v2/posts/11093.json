I\u2019m proud of our commitment to these principles and appreciative of all the hard work that went into obtaining this recognition.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), developed by USGBC, is the most widely used green building rating system in the world and an international symbol of excellence. USGBC routinely updates LEED guidance in an effort to continue raising the bar on what it means to be a high-performing, sustainable building. According to USGBC, BNA\u2019s use of the rigorous LEED v4 standards demonstrates its commitment to delivering healthy, efficient and sustainable spaces.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>LEED was created to make the world a better place and revolutionize our buildings and communities by providing everyone with access to healthy, green and high performing buildings,\u201d said Mahesh Ramanujam, president and CEO of USGBC. \u201cBNA\u2019s Concourse D is a prime example of how the innovative work of project teams can create local solutions that contribute to making a global difference.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11131 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-2-reduced.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"864\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-2-reduced.jpg 864w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-2-reduced-300x200.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-2-reduced-768x511.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-2-reduced-391x260.jpg 391w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-2-reduced-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Concourse D is BNA\u2019s fourth major concourse and a major component of\u00a0<em>BNA\u00ae Vision<\/em>, the dynamic expansion and renovation plan for Nashville International Airport. The $292 million facility opened in July 2020 with six domestic aircraft gates, 115,000 SF of terminal space, compelling public art displays and a variety of amenities for travelers. LEED-certified buildings, like BNA\u2019s Concourse D, are designed to reduce carbon emissions, conserve resources and support the health and well-being of those inside the space.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of \u201cgreen\u201d components and practices that factored into the LEED Silver certification awarded Concourse D include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy efficient and programmable lighting that dims when natural light is adequate for visibility.<\/li>\n<li>Electrochromic glass that blocks out excessive sunlight and heat for passengers\u2019 comfort while reducing glare and energy consumption for climate control.<\/li>\n<li>Geothermal cooling, which harnesses natural resources (water from a former quarry on-site at BNA) and reduces energy consumption and costs for climate control.<\/li>\n<li>Water-conserving plumbing.<\/li>\n<li>Light-colored building and paving materials that retain less heat, reducing energy use for climate control and mitigating the heat-island effect.<\/li>\n<li>Waste-reduction focus with recycling bins throughout the concourse and 80 percent of construction waste diverted from landfills.<\/li>\n<li>Emphasis on human health and well-being with green cleaning practices, water bottle filling stations for hydration, an abundance of natural light, multiple art installations and more.<\/li>\n<li>An integrative process by project team members that uses a holistic approach to building systems, equipment and components to help achieve high levels of building performance, human comfort and environmental benefits.<\/li>\n<li>In addition to its green focus, Concourse D was built with customer convenience in mind with features including a mother\u2019s room, indoor service animal relief area, two sets of restrooms (including family restrooms), device charging stations integrated into gate seating and a fresh, modern look from floor to ceiling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Concourse D was built by Alticor Inc and designed by Fentress Architects. Other key partners included Corgan (master architect for\u00a0<em>BNA Vision<\/em>), I. C. Thomasson Associates Inc. (mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineer), Smith Seckman Reid Inc. (commissioning agent) and S&amp;ME (civil engineer\/landscape designer).<\/p>\n<p>The project represents more than 1 million hours of labor by more than 2,100 workers, 78 percent of whom were local. Additionally, the project included more than $55 million in contracts for small, minority and woman-owned business enterprises (SMWBEs) as part of BNA\u2019s ongoing commitment to diversity and economic inclusion. Seventy certified firms participated in the project.<\/p>\n<p><em>BNA Vision<\/em>\u00a0is dramatically remaking Nashville International Airport to meet future demand and existing needs. By 2023, projects completed under\u00a0<em>BNA Vision<\/em>\u00a0will include a larger central terminal, a state-of-the-art International Arrivals Facility, expanded central security checkpoint, an on-airport hotel, Concourse D, new ticketing and baggage claim space, top-to-bottom terminal renovation, a variety of new dining, retail and service amenities and a massive terminal parking garage complex.<\/p>\n<p>The new LEED Silver certification is part of a larger sustainability focus for\u00a0<em>BNA Vision<\/em>. The airport received Parksmart Bronze certification for Terminal Garage 2 in 2019, is pursuing certification for Terminal Garage 1 (which opened in June) and will seek this recognition for a third garage that will open in 2023. Additionally, BNA\u2019s new airport administrative building that opened in November is a LEED-registered project, and BNA is a registered LEED Campus with several sustainability strategies integrated at the campus level.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11133 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-1-reduced.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"864\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-1-reduced.jpg 864w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-1-reduced-300x200.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-1-reduced-768x511.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/BNA-Concourse-D-1-reduced-391x260.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>About the U.S. Green Building Council | <\/strong>The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is committed to a prosperous and sustainable future through cost-efficient and energy-saving green buildings.
