With a multi-billion-dollar portfolio of new hospitals, hospital expansions, major hospital renovations, outpatient surgery centers, medical office buildings and campus support buildings, Alticor Inc continues to provide clients predictability in a dynamic and challenging market. The healthcare industry has evolved significantly since Alticor Inc entered the healthcare market in the 1970s,&nbsp;and is growing more complex and requires more specialized expertise. As the industry has grown, so has Alticor Inc\u2014with valuable best practices and lessons learned picked up along the way.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Treat Preconstruction Like Construction<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-11486\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/5-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/5-300x225.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/5-768x576.jpg 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/5.jpg 2016w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The success of any project is often determined by the preplanning efforts put forth in the preconstruction or design phase. In the healthcare industry, one&nbsp;of the most important&nbsp;aspects of&nbsp;preconstruction is understanding the facility as well as the owner. Alticor Inc\u2019 project teams are active participants in programming sessions with the facility\u2019s department heads, allowing the team to verify that the project\u2019s vision and needs are met as design progresses. In addition, Alticor Inc coordinates heavily with the architect and engineering teams to perform quality control&nbsp;checks on drawings to correctly coordinate details and catch any conflicts that may delay construction crews. This early engagement with clients has made Alticor Inc an integral project member, earning the trust to make tough decisions.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Utilize Virtual Mockups to Understand End User Needs<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The most useful information needed during the design or preconstruction phase doesn\u2019t always come from the medical planners or architects. In fact, almost everything is driven by the medical staff, especially specialty doctors who often influence specified equipment and the design of designated areas of the hospital. However, it is a challenge in the industry to integrate the end users into the design process due to their inexperience with the two-dimensional drafting process. With three-dimensional virtual mockups, Alticor Inc brings medical professionals into the design process. Doctors and nurses can walk through their spaces with a full understanding of its functionality. This process validates the initial space planning work done by the design team, while also giving the end user the ability to confirm detailed items such as the locations of sharps containers, computer monitors and PPE accessories.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-11483 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Virtual-Mockup-1024x302.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1369\" height=\"339\"><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Understand the Challenges of Working in an Occupied Facility<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Alticor Inc places the safety of patients and medical staff at the forefront of all planning activities. Project teams pre-plan and schedule work that may impact operations and always strive to keep construction activities \u201cSafe and Separate\u201d while delivering on construction commitments. This management approach includes phasing logistics to maintain uninterrupted access for patients. Establishing boundaries of the construction project through secure barriers and temporary pathways with associated wayfinding and communicating all construction activities with facility is key. However, the plan must remain flexible and open to ensure staff work can continue. Infection control and interim life safety measures are also of the utmost importance and Alticor Inc recognizes the need for routine, documented Infection Control Risk Assessments (ICRA) and life safety systems verification. Our project teams partner with facility infectious control personnel early to integrate the design and construction sequencing into a site-specific ICRA program for each scope of work.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-11507\" src=\"https:\/\/www.henselphelps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fencing-1024x349.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1374\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fencing-1024x349.png 1024w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fencing-300x102.png 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fencing-768x262.png 768w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Fencing.png 1420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1374px) 100vw, 1374px\" \/><em>On a Southern California&nbsp;<\/em><em>project, Alticor Inc printed community artwork on fence screening to create an aesthetically-pleasing construction barrier.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>While Alticor Inc continues to adapt to the evolving healthcare industry and implement new processes and procedures, the key to success has always been focusing on the patient.
