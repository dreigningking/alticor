										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The LAUSD Belvedere Middle School Comprehensive Modernization is an all-inclusive enhancement of the site, buildings, infrastructure, accessibility and security measures of the 527,000 SF operational campus. The project consolidates all but one of the existing 21 buildings into six new structures consisting of technology-enabled classrooms, labs and other support spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the many upgrades include 24 modernized classrooms and six laboratories, integrated special education environments, dedicated performing arts spaces, upgraded food services, a new gymnasium and all new ball courts and playfields. Complete ADA upgrades allow universal accessibility across the site, and the dense campus plan reduces travel distances between buildings for both students and faculty. The buildings are organized around a central plaza, and in combination with the architectural porch concept used at each building entry, this arrangement acknowledges the historical context of the surrounding community while promoting security on an open campus. Large murals, completed by local artists, are Integrated throughout the campus resulting in a wholly modernized learning environment that elevates the student and faculty experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>In 2020, Jacobs, contracted by Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southeast, awarded Alticor Inc a hard-bid contract under a best value scenario to work collaboratively for NAVFAC. Alticor Inc provided design-assist preconstruction and construction services on the renovation of Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola Building 633.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The historic brick building with white columns is the heart of the Naval Aviation Schools Command where generations of naval aviators have trained since 1941. The two-story facility consists of administrative spaces, classrooms, and an auditorium. Renovations included a large-scale mechanical renovation, interior aesthetic upgrades, hazardous materials abatement, a new fire alarm and mass notification system, demolition of interior walls, terrazzo floor refurbishment, two new handicapped restrooms, door security infrastructure. The mechanical upgrades included the removal and replacement of the existing HVAC system, removal and replacement of two cooling towers, two chillers, and three boilers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All renovations were required to be approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Navy to ensure the renovation preserved the building’s historic integrity. Additionally, the team was tasked with protecting existing historic elements in the facility such as various 1930’s era paintings and murals. With Building 633 residing on an active military base, the project required several highly secure components and heavy coordination to maintain daily operations. Cybersecurity requirements included third-party computer scanning and inactive USBs such as on the fire alarm controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most special part of this renovation project was the opportunity to help give due honor and remembrance to three fallen soldiers by building out a memorial room. The commemorative sitting room features a red wall with a painted white NAS Pensacola heart illustrative of heart patches that were provided for service members, first responders, and the local community. The design was made by local community member, Robbie Harvey, and the painting was produced by Bradley Deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With dedicated teamwork and collaboration, the team was able to deliver to NAVFAC a refreshed and upgraded facility for future aviation students in the Navy, Marine Crops, and Coast Guard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Fawcett Elementary School project in Tacoma, WA includes the design and construction of a replacement elementary school on the existing site of the current school. The project includes demolition of the existing 64,000 SF facility and construction of a new 55,000 SF two-story building to house approximately 400 students. Delivered in partnership with Tacoma based design firm BLRB Architects, the progressive design-build project provides a new parking lot, covered and paved play areas and an all-purpose field. Fawcett presents challenges related to the fast-track construction of the new facility on the small, 5.6-acre site that has sloping topography and is surrounded by dense, single-family residential neighborhoods on all sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Design goals for the project include:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">• A building design that provides access to natural light, fresh air, outdoor learning and work areas and promotes a healthy working, teaching and learning environment.<br />
• A building and site design that provides a safe and secure environment for working, teaching and learning.<br />
• A building design that is reflective of the current trends in educational program, teaching methods and technology and provides flexibility so that it can be easily adapted to future changes in program, teaching methods and technology.<br />
• An educational environment that supports a collaborative and flexible teaching and educational program.<br />
• Building systems that are energy/resource efficient, easily maintained and can provide a minimum of 30 years serviceability with a reasonable life-cycle cost.<br />
• A building design that accommodates and encourages public use of the facility when school is not in session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Alticor Inc and BLRB team will work closely with Tacoma Public Schools to increase both local business participation from 15% to 30% and overall business equity inclusion goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The progressive design-build Interdisciplinary Engineering Building (IEB) provides a student-focused, interdisciplinary center enabling the College of Engineering to promote project-based learning and research, collaboration and innovation for undergraduate students. Delivered with architect KieranTimberlake, the project provides 72,000 SF of hands-on learning and flexible instructional space to support over 950 new students across the ten academic departments with offices and wet and dry modular labs. By providing the silo-free learning environments that students need to prepare for industry and entrepreneurial careers in collaboration with fellow students across campus, the new building both relieves pressure on the College’s departmental buildings and supports their integration into degree programs while developing real-world engineering and leadership skills. The IEB will house programming for leadership, diversity and access, as well as dedicated space for industry-sponsored capstone projects to strengthen connections between the UW and industry. The project is situated on an extremely constrained, hillside site within the active university campus of over 40,000 students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The project required demolition of four smaller buildings to make way for the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
