										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">The SeaWorld Aquatica SP2 project is a redevelopment of the Aquatica San Diego water park into the &#8220;Sesame Street&#8221;-themed park, the first such theme park on the West Coast and only the second in the country. The refreshed park joined Legoland in Carlsbad, California, as the only two theme parks in the nation that primarily tailor their services to children. The 17-acre, two-phase redevelopment was re-branded and re-named Sesame Place and incorporated many existing water attractions into the new park. These were built to cater to younger children and remain appealing to all ages. Sesame Place will be a Certified Autism Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">The extensive makeover by Alticor Inc of SeaWorld’s Aquatica Sesame Place San Diego featured seven theme park rides geared toward younger kids and 11 water park attractions with the highlight of the new park, a recreation of the “Sesame Street” television show set.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p>The Allure Apollo project is the second phase of a three-phase, mixed-use, multifamily, transit-oriented Apollo development. Allure includes 384 Class-A apartment units consisting of 18 studio units, 176 one-bedroom units, and 190 two-bedroom units. An above-ground parking garage serves residents and can accommodate 650 cars. Once complete, all phases of development will create an urban town center development adjacent to the Branch Avenue Metro Station located in Camp Springs, MD. The town center will introduce a new retail center and office space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is a combination of 3A (six stories wood frame over podium) and 5A (six stories wood frame) construction which wraps around a precast concrete-structured parking garage. The multifamily apartments carry high level finishes including granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and electronic controlled access to common areas and apartments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allure Apollo also includes a large amenities package. Indoor amenities include a theater, bar, card room, game room, fitness and yoga studio, conference space, and club room. The outdoor amenities include a courtyard area with a pool, bocce ball court, zen garden and extensive landscaping package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, Alticor Inc completed construction of the first phase of the master plan, <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/ascend-apollo/">Ascend Apollo</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About The Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Alticor Inc was the Construction Manager at Risk for the GEO Group’s new seven-story corporate global headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. The Florida-based company specializes in privatized corrections, detention, and mental health treatment facilities around the world. The new state-of-the-art facility provides space and amenities for more than 300 employees. The fully-integrated Class-A office building includes 106,000 SF of office space on top of three stories of parking garage and houses all their legal, accounting, human resources, and U.S. corrections operations. Each of the top four floors include administrative offices, executive suites, kitchen space, and training rooms. Additional office amenities include an executive board room, a large in-house training room, a club room, BIM/IT production rooms, an in-house call center, and a large indoor and outdoor pre-function/entertainment space on the level four terrace to host company events and entertain clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building is comprised of a concrete frame structure on shallow spread footings and is finished off with a top of the line curtainwall system. A curtainwall system is the outer covering of the building in which the outer walls are non-structural and merely keep the weather out and the occupants in. The all-glass curtainwall makes for a great advantage in that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The garage is screened with a specialized Vert-A-Cade screening system that is aesthetically pleasing while it screens activities and vehicles within the garage from view of the general public areas. To increase the buildings aesthetics, white architectural precast and Alucobond paneling in signature “GEO blue” were incorporated into the building’s design to make the building “pop”, especially due to its high visibility being located near Interstate 95.</p>
