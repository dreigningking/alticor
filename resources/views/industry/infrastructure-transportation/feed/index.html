										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p>Located adjacent to the Sound Transit Sounder line station, the Puyallup Station Parking and Access Improvements project provides a new, five-level, 510-space parking garage and expands the existing surface lot to accommodate 167-spaces. The project provides a new pedestrian bridge and improves traffic operations with new traffic signalization and multiple left and right-turn pocket lanes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the vision set by Sound Transit and the City of Puyallup, the Alticor Inc | KPFF | Mithun design-build team worked to design a functional and durable facility that strengthens Puyallup’s identity of place and honors Native tribes—including the Steilcoom, Muckleshoot, Puyallup and Yakima—and Puyallup’s rich history as one of Washington State’s oldest settlements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The facility blends natural and industrial materials and incorporates an exoskeleton language which reflects bridge construction over the Puyallup River. Additionally, the facility features large curtain wall elevator towers used to display local art that will cement this garage as a local landmark building. Low impact development streetscape plants, and warm subtle nighttime architectural lighting along the garage façades, as well as the sustainable pocket park, create a welcoming environment for transit users and local pedestrians. Bicycle sharrow, or shared-lane markings, on the adjacent streets and smart bicycle lockers at the station platform, support the City of Puyallup’s goal to expand multi-modal transportation. The structure will be reinforced concrete columns and post-tensioned beams and floor decks that will provide a durable facility that supports long-term use by Sound Transit patrons. The design-build team is collaborating with BNSF to ensure there are no impacts to the active adjacent rail line and continues to coordinate with Puyallup High School and numerous businesses which remained operational throughout construction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>Alticor Inc served as a teamed super subcontractor to Stacey and Witbeck/Kuney, a Joint Venture for the $731,596,000 Downtown Redmond Link Extension project. Alticor Inc served as the design-builder for the 1400-stall, six-story, 615,000 SF Parking Garage and as the general contractor/construction manager for one at-grade station adjacent to the Parking Garage and one elevated station in downtown Redmond. The Downtown Redmond Station is pursuing LEED for Transportation Gold certification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Parking Garage</strong> is comprised of a post-tensioned, cast-in-place concrete system. Level 1 of the garage (at-grade) supports King County Metro and Sound Transit operations and features four active and eight layover bays for bus operations. The upper level features a 90 kW photovoltaic array and serves as a covered pedestrian walkway. To better blend with future mixed-use projects in the adjacent Marymoor Village area, the garage is clad with brick, glass, metal panels, perforated and articulated metal panels and tension mesh. A glass curtainwall clads two feature stairs at the south elevation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>SE Redmond Station</strong> is an at-grade station adjacent to the garage and is accessed from the garage via a glass clad stair from Level 2 to the station platform. The 380-foot long platform is highlighted with a glass and metal clad canopy and multiple glass and steel wind screen structures. The platform surface is a precast concrete paver system with integral tactile wayfinding. This station provides two Ticket Vending Machine areas protected from the weather by glass and steel canopies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Downtown Redmond Station</strong> is the terminus of the East Link Extension and is constructed approximately 25’ above grade. The elevated platform is accessed via two entries, or head houses. Each head house features brick, glass and metal panel cladding and contains a stair, elevator and escalator. The site is heavily landscaped and includes plazas amenities for the City of Redmond to utilize as small-scale event space. The elevated guideway provides a storage tail track for rail car staging to support peak service demand times. This tail track features unique architectural treatments including brick and perforated panels to provide wayfinding and architectural interest at this terminus.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The San Ysidro Land Port of Entry – Phase 2 project was designed and constructed to be the first government-owned, 24-hour/365-day facility to achieve LEED Platinum, Zero Net Energy and Zero Net Water certifications. The overhauled 39-acre port of entry features heightened standards in efficiency, security, aesthetics and sustainability. The project included the preservation of the original 24,000 SF Historic Customs House built in 1932 and a complete reconstruction of the port’s 102,000 SF northbound pedestrian processing building and pedestrian and bus inspection facilities, which included inspection booths for 18 northbound pedestrian processing lanes and four northbound bus processing lanes. Due to the importance of this facility to both national security and cross-border regional economies, it was mandatory to ensure the port always remained active during construction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Alticor Inc Design-Build team was given an unique opportunity to be a part of the Commercial Crew program. NASA’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) brings the United States one step closer to launching crews back into space from American soil. Commercial transportation to and from the International Space Station (ISS) will provide for additional research and discovery on the orbiting laboratory. The station is critical for NASA’s continued research for understanding and overcoming the challenges of long-duration space exploration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The CCtCap project for United Launch Alliance provided the retrofitting of Launch Complex – 41 to accommodate the new CT-100 Starliner Space Capsule. The project includes a new Crew Access Tower (CAT), a Crew Access Arm (CAA) and modifications to the platforms inside the existing Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) building adjacent to the Launch Complex. The Crew Access Tower supports the Crew Access Arm, which is movable by a hydraulic system, and will allow future astronauts easy access to the CT-100 Starliner Capsule. The platforms inside the VIF building, where the rockets are stacked, was renovated to fit the outer mold of the new capsule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Due to the complexity and uniqueness of the project, this job was completed in two phases: Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) and Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap). CCiCap was the original contract awarded to the Alticor Inc Design-Build team, which consisted of all of the design and preplanning required to complete CCtCap. CCtCap was an option that was awarded post contract. The safety of the American astronauts was first and foremost from day one&#8211;ensuring that the CAT and the CAA would provide safe access to the CT-100 Capsule and remain fully functionally after multiple launches was priority one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The design-build Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority’s (MWAA) Railyard and Maintenance Facility project consists of the construction of a new maintenance facility that serves the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority&#8217;s (WMATA) Silver Metro Line. The new, $351 million campus-style maintenance facility is located on the grounds of Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun County, Virginia. The facility is comprised of six primary buildings and eight support structures. Each primary building serves a unique purpose to the overall operation and maintenance of the Silver Metro Line. These buildings include the Service and Inspection (S&amp;I) Building, the Maintenance of Way (MOW) building, the Train Wash Facility, Warehouse building, Vehicle Storage Building (VSB), and Transportation and Police Building. The ancillary structures support maintenance operations on the property and include a salt dome, guardhouse, secondary vehicle storage building (STB), two traction power substations (TPSS 21 and TPSS 21A) and three train control rooms (TCRs A, B and C).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The railyard houses and services over 220 rail cars during off-peak and off-hour times and provides all the necessary components and support services for maintenance. The 186,000 SF S&amp;I building includes a yard control tower and its primary function is the maintenance, repair, interior and exterior cleaning of the rail cars. The 66,000 SF MOW building&#8217;s primary function is the maintenance and repair of the revenue track maintenance equipment. The 14,900 SF Train Wash Facility houses an automatic system that sends the trains through multiple cleaning and drying stations before exiting the facility. The 50,000 SF Warehouse building stores rail car maintenance parts. The 2,000 SF Vehicle Storage Building functions as a garage for maintenance of way vehicles. The 35,000 SF Transportation and Police Building houses the WMATA police and transportation department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project scope includes site work, the construction of all 14 structures on the campus and the installation of almost nine miles of track. The site work scope made the 95-acre site ready for construction and included level and grading and the construction of a retaining wall. The primary structures consist of structural steel frames with precast concrete exteriors. The installation of the third rail required extensive preliminary underground investigations and BIM coordination to construct a grounding grid.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400">The San Ysidro Land Port of Entry Phase 1B project, at the world’s busiest land port, is now a model “Port of the Future” that has achieved new standards in efficiency, security, aesthetics and sustainability. The 39-acre facility, which processes 50,000 vehicles and 25,000 pedestrians daily, now features heightened levels of efficiency, visibility and security. This was achieved by the replacement of 70 support columns with four high-performance pylons, the construction of a 30,000 SF primary inspection canopy, a 62,000 SF secondary inspection canopy and 26 vehicle processing lanes with two tandem officer booths per lane. Wait times for border crossings have dropped from over four hours to less than 20 minutes. It is the first government-owned 24-hour/365-day facility to achieve LEED Platinum, NetZero Energy and NetZero Water certifications.</p>
