										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The South Fort Collins Sanitation District (SFCSD) Project expanded the Water Reclamation Facility to accommodate growth within the service area, increasing its capacity from 4.5 million gallons per day (MGD) to six MGD during Phase 1 (with provisions to expand to nine MGD in the future). This project included nutrient removal facilities to meet the limits of Regulation 85. Additional improvements to the solids handling facilities enabled SFCSD to reuse their biosolids (in compliance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 503 biosolids regulation). The project added several new facilities: a step feed aeration basin, blower building, secondary clarifier, Auto Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion and a biofilter. Components of the project included rotary drum thickeners, influent pumps, blowers, pumps and a UV system. Other improvements included yard piping, grading, paving, electrical and instrumentation and control.</p>

<p>The Drake Water Reclamation Facility Project entailed the construction of a new sidestream phosphorous removal system, including a new building with process equipment and mechanical and electrical work. The new cogeneration system involved recovering digester gas to generate heat and electricity, and included yard piping, concrete, electrical and controls and instrumentation, as well as the installation of a gas conditioner and two owner-furnished co-generators. This project also included process pipe modifications in the digester building; the installation of chemical metering pumps, skids and distribution piping for the north and south process train aeration basins; and the demolition and removal of the existing chlorine scrubber. The facility has the capacity to treat 23 million gallons per day (MGD) and manages the biosolids for both the Drake and the Mulberry Water Reclamation Facilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The Waianae Wastewater Treat Plant (WWTP) Improvements and Upgrade project consisted of the construction of a new 2W (No. 2 non-potable water) piping network with isolation valves, rehabilitation of primary clarifiers and influent/effluent distribution boxes and piping, 2W seal water system improvements, construction of new headworks influent screens and washer/compactors and modifications to the grit removal system and pre-aeration tanks. In addition to improvements and new construction, Alticor Inc was also responsible for soil erosion and sediment control, electrical site work, temporary diversion pumping for work at the primary treatment unit process and start-up, testing, and commissioning of systems.</p>
<p>Alticor Inc completed 75 percent of the self-perform work on the project, including concrete repairs and installation; demolition; air ductwork; the installation of the underground 2W line, primary clarifier mechanisms, scum piping, spray piping, tubing, biotrickling filter system, hydropneumatic tank, centrifugal pump, slide gate, perforated plate screen and mechanically cleaned bar screen. Alticor Inc also planned outages and bypass work.</p>
<p>Although work on the project has concluded, Alticor Inc continues work at Waianae WWTP under a separate contract for the biosolids dewatering system replacement.</p>

<p>The City and County of Honolulu awarded Alticor Inc the $22 million Kaneohe/Kailua Tunnel Influent Facility project located at the Kaneohe Wastewater Pre-Treatment Facility (WWTF) in Kaneohe, Hawaii. It was the third and final phase of the City and County of Honolulu’s Kaneohe-Kailua Wastewater Conveyance and Treatment Facilities project. The project included structural finishing, mechanical, architectural, electrical and instrumentation work at diversion, drop structures, and junction structures for the new conveyance tunnel. It also included a new generator building and odor control systems improvements. To ensure the City met a U.S. EPA consent decree, Alticor Inc also assisted with tunnel work, installing fiberglass to seal ports and joints in the tunnel.</p>

<div>
<p>The City and County of Honolulu awarded Alticor Inc the $149 million Kailua Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (KRWWTP) project located in Kailua, Hawaii. The project is part of a 25 year, $4 billion consent decree between the City and County of Honolulu and the EPA that will upgrade and expand several existing plants within the County.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The KRWWTP project includes construction of the Tunnel Influent Pump Station (TIPS), Mini Kailua Influent Pump Station, Generator/ Electrical Distribution Building, Fuel Tank Pad, Headworks Facility, Sewer Pump Station and Force Main. The work also involves site utility and drainage system improvements. The TIPS features a 90-foot diameter, four-level cast-in-place concrete structure that extends over 100 feet below grade and two levels aboveground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project is one component of the Kaneohe/ Kailua Sewer Tunnel Project that is intended to convey wastewater flows from the Kaneohe Wastewater Pretreatment Facility to the (KRWWTP) and provide storage for peak wet-weather flows. The plan is to reduce overflows that occur when wastewater flows exceed the capacity of the existing KRWWTP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alticor Inc self-performed the installation of the mechanical process piping, structural concrete, and other miscellaneous items for the project.</p>
