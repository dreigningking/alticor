										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>Alticor Inc was the design-builder for the 71,423 SF Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Testing and Evaluation (BAMSTE) Hangar Facility project. This facility was designed in collaboration with Giuliani Associates Architects for NAVFAC Washington, and supports the BAMS Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) program. The BAMS UAS program delivers real-time intelligence information to operational and tactical users such as the Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG), Carrier Strike Group (CSG) and the Joint Forces Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design and construction of the facility was in strict compliance with the UFC 4-010-01 and UFC 4-211-01N, DoD Minimum Anti-Terrorism Standards for Buildings. The two-story, high-bay hangar accommodates three BAMS UAS platforms and a second-story equipped with operations, maintenance, storage, equipment testing, office and administrative spaces situated at the rear of the hangar. The scope of work included design and construction of an aircraft parking apron, taxiway access, line vehicle parking spaces, a 1,000 SF fiber distribution node (FDN) and shelter, roadways, on-site parking for 205 vehicles and other site improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The support areas include three evaluation labs: mechanical testing (800 SF), avionics testing (800 SF) and instrumentation testing (600 SF). A mission control suite contains two 500 SF training/operations rooms with a central 500 SF instructor observation room supported by a secure 1,000 SF server room. Aircraft performance data is evaluated by engineers and analysts housed in a 1,600 SF secure suite supported by a dedicated server room. The testing and evaluation functions are supported by an 11,000 SF open office area, 1,200 SF private office space, two 600 SF conference rooms and two 400 SF secure briefing rooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional features of the facility include a three-coat fuel resistive resinous flooring system on the hangar bay floor; a five-ton, under-running overhead crane that covers the entire hangar bay; an aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) fire suppression system; and a 1,500 SF SCIF area on the second floor of the administrative space that was constructed in complete accordance with ICD 705.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BAMS testing and evaluation hangar was designed and constructed to LEED Silver standards for certification through the USGBC. Sustainable features included a low-impact development (LID) stormwater design; a high-efficiency HVAC system that provides over 60% energy savings compared to ASHRAE 90.1; a solar domestic hot water system; a thermally improved exterior envelope; translucent wall panels above the hangar doors that increase daylighting into the hangar bay; improved lighting with high output fixtures in the Hangar Bays and office/administrative areas; and an overall direct digital control (DDC) building management system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>In 2020, Jacobs, contracted by Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southeast, awarded Alticor Inc a hard-bid contract under a best value scenario to work collaboratively for NAVFAC. Alticor Inc provided design-assist preconstruction and construction services on the renovation of Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola Building 633.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The historic brick building with white columns is the heart of the Naval Aviation Schools Command where generations of naval aviators have trained since 1941. The two-story facility consists of administrative spaces, classrooms, and an auditorium. Renovations included a large-scale mechanical renovation, interior aesthetic upgrades, hazardous materials abatement, a new fire alarm and mass notification system, demolition of interior walls, terrazzo floor refurbishment, two new handicapped restrooms, door security infrastructure. The mechanical upgrades included the removal and replacement of the existing HVAC system, removal and replacement of two cooling towers, two chillers, and three boilers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All renovations were required to be approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Navy to ensure the renovation preserved the building’s historic integrity. Additionally, the team was tasked with protecting existing historic elements in the facility such as various 1930’s era paintings and murals. With Building 633 residing on an active military base, the project required several highly secure components and heavy coordination to maintain daily operations. Cybersecurity requirements included third-party computer scanning and inactive USBs such as on the fire alarm controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most special part of this renovation project was the opportunity to help give due honor and remembrance to three fallen soldiers by building out a memorial room. The commemorative sitting room features a red wall with a painted white NAS Pensacola heart illustrative of heart patches that were provided for service members, first responders, and the local community. The design was made by local community member, Robbie Harvey, and the painting was produced by Bradley Deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With dedicated teamwork and collaboration, the team was able to deliver to NAVFAC a refreshed and upgraded facility for future aviation students in the Navy, Marine Crops, and Coast Guard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The modernization of the 12-story Social Security Administration (SSA) Arthur J. Altmeyer Building includes an extensive interior overhaul and removal of all existing façade down to the primary structure consisting of cast-in-place concrete columns, beams and floor slabs. The new exterior envelope is a panelized wall system, providing the occupants a comfort level that maximizes productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first phase of the modernization included the removal of lead paint and asbestos, and ripping out corroded plumbing to meet current code and accessibility standards. The entire roof was also replaced. The updates to the 250,000 SF facility consisted of the optimization of the building’s performance systems including new state-of-the-art security systems and updated MEP systems. A more modern open-space office layout and new elevators were also included. The top four floors now consist of Executive offices, while the bottom four floors contain open office spaces. Also included is a penthouse space on the ninth floor and one basement level below-grade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second phase of the project included the demolition and abatement of the building’s auditorium space. Phase 3 encompassed the balance of the scope to build back the project after demolition and abatement. This included the modernization of the adjacent 11,000 SF auditorium and associated spaces including various state-of-the-art systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;">About This Project</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sitting on a 11.8 acre site in Blaine, WA, the U.S. General Services Administration, Region 10 &#8211; Pacific Highway Land Port of Entry (LPOE) Building Envelope consists of two buildings – the Auto/Bus Building and the Commercial/Warehouse Building. The Port, which was expanded and renovated in 1999, is the main commercial port of entry between the State of Washington and British Columbia, Canada, and is operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The facility is home to five agencies including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the U.S. Department of Interior — Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &#8211; Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. General Services Administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The 117,131 SF design-build project is comprised of the exterior envelope restoration and re-roofing of the existing Auto/Bus and Commercial/Warehouse Buildings to resolve long-term water infiltration, air leakage, moisture control, mold and overall performance issues. Under the GSA Design Excellence Program, and delivered in partnership with lead architect, Jones Studio, and building envelope consultant, Wiss Janney Elstner Associates, this project required complete re-design, removal and installation of a new exterior envelope, roof replacement and rebalancing of the existing HVAC to match the new exterior enclosures. In addition, it required a multi-phased approach for roofing and vertical skin components, which allowed the work to progress in a logical and efficient manner while minimizing interruption to the 24/7 tenant operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is Alticor Inc&#8217; 33rd project for the U.S. General Services Administration, and seventh project supporting the U.S. Customs and Border Protection at active Land Ports of Entry. To learn more about Alticor Inc&#8217; portfolio of successfully completed Land Port of Entry projects, visit: <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/san-ysidro-land-port-entry-phase-2-2/">https://www.henselphelps.com/project/san-ysidro-land-port-entry-phase-2-2/</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The United States Military’s Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC)’s goal was to combine medical training for all enlisted military personnel at one location in Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas in order to increase efficiency, save money and allow all service branches to learn from one another. The new Medical Education and Training Campus (METC) was created to achieve this goal, requiring housing facilities to be constructed in a very short timeframe in order to accommodate the servicemen and women who would quickly occupy the campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alticor Inc performed as the design-builder on five separate task orders under an IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct five new dormitory facilities. Due to the daunting schedule, the decision was made early to rely on modular design. Each modular unit consisted of two dorm rooms, two mechanical rooms and a hallway. The units were constructed off-site, complete with finishes, exterior windows, mechanical/electrical/plumbing and fire protection systems. Constructing the actual buildings was a large-scale, highly precise exercise in stacking blocks. Foundations were poured and once modules were carefully aligned and set into place, utilities were connected and the rooms were complete, leaving only the roof to install. Overall, approximately 80 percent of the building was produced off-site, leaving only 20 percent of the scope to be site constructed. The modular approach saved time, improved quality control and solved the challenge of a regional labor shortage. It also reduced site impacts, an important goal in achieving its LEED Gold certification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the five dormitory projects completed on this campus, Alticor Inc also completed a running track and a jogging path set in a park filled with native Texas plants as part of the project’s scope. The park features signs describing the sustainability strategies used to address LEED categories including water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources and indoor environmental quality. The park provides opportunities for exercise as well as education about green design.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The Diplomatic Security Service is the law enforcement and security arm of the U.S. Department of State. It bears the core responsibility for providing a safe environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to the  Foreign Affairs Security Training Center (FASTC) program, diplomatic security training was conducted at a number of diffuse, leased and contracted facilities nationwide. A May 2008 report to Congress identified the need for a consolidated facility to improve training efficiency, decrease operating costs and provide priority access to training venues which meet current facility standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, the U.S. Department of State established FASTC at Fort Pickett and on adjacent property near Blackstone, Virginia. FASTC provides hard-skills security training to State Department personnel and the foreign affairs community. The U.S. Department of State, working with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) worked extensively to conduct environmental studies at Fort Pickett, which showed that the site was suitable for FASTC. In 2015, GSA purchased property and secured land use agreements for approximately 1,400 acres of publicly held land.</p>

<p>This facility is dedicated to providing consolidated hard skills security and lifesaving training to the foreign affairs community. This training develops the practical skills necessary to operate in today’s overseas environment. Hard skills training allows the foreign affairs community to learn how to detect surveillance, provide emergency medical care, increase identification skills to recognize improvised explosive devices (IED), participate in firearms familiarization and perform defensive/counterterrorist driving maneuvers. Such training improves security and life safety for the protection of U.S. personnel operating abroad. The FASTC facility trains 8,000 &#8211; 10,000 students annually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alticor Inc completed Contract 1 of the FASTC program in February 2017. Scope of work included an explosives demonstration range, live-fire shoot house, mock outdoor urban training (MOUT) area, rappel tower, tactical maze and smoke house. Included with each venue are associated site-work and infrastructure necessary for general accessibility to the site parcels and integration of utilities and infrastructure shared in common with off-site venues and other facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contract 3 was completed in January 2020 and consisted of a fitness center, warehouse space, multiple drive tracks, multiple classrooms, explosive training areas, firing ranges and an armory.</p>
