										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Alticor Inc is currently providing design-build services on the Main Terminal Curbside Expansion program at Tampa International Airport (TPA). The major renovation is designed to create a new set of express arrival and departure lanes for passengers who have no need for curbside services, ticketing or checking luggage. This allows all passengers who are not checking bags with airlines to access the “Express Curb”, which bypasses the ticket lobby entirely and provides direct access to the gates. The innovation reduces curbside congestion while providing a new and enhanced level of customer service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The project includes the expansion of 32 lanes from 16, incorporating both at-grade and elevated roadways along with Vertical Circulation Buildings (VCB) for both TPA’s Blue Side and Red Side. The VCB&#8217;s are three-floor air-conditioned atriums that provide direct access from the new express curbsides to the Transfer Level of the Main Terminal via elevators, escalators and enclosed walkways. These buildings also connect to the adjacent Long Term Parking Garage on the Blue Side and Marriott Hotel on the Red Side. The Red Side VCB also includes a Shuttle Platform that will connect with the future Airside D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Blue Side VCB opened to the public two months ahead of schedule in November 2021, just in time for passengers to enjoy the benefits of the new curbsides ahead of the busy holiday season. Once inside the VCB, passengers are greeted by two large wall art installations, glass wall panels, stainless steel column covers, terrazzo floors throughout and an intricate monumental staircase as the centerpiece. Passengers can then take the elevator, escalator or stairs up one level to the Main Terminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Blue Side VCB phase of the program also includes the replacement of the existing central utility plant (CUP) with a new 4,800-ton capacity plant, which went online just before the 2021 holiday season. The new CUP and Electrical Service Building is housed in a 10,000 SF building and provides heating, cooling, potable water and fire protection for the Main Terminal, Baggage Handling, Network Operations Center, Sky Connect station, new Vertical Circulation Buildings and the Authority’s new Maintenance and Police Headquarters. The new highly efficient chiller plant reduces overall energy costs by 30%, equal to removing 620 cars from the roads and 50 million gallons of potable water per year. The design features cast-in-place concrete cooling towers that double as an illuminated waterfall feature and multi-colored pipe jacketing that each represent heating, fire protection, water and power to the airport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Other significant features of the Red Side phase of the project include the renovation of the loading dock, replacement of the FAA parking lot, replacement of the existing curbsides’ architectural ceilings, construction of a new Police and Maintenance Department Building and demolition of the existing administration building. The project is on a very tight site and constructs the adjoining terminal building expansions and curbside roadway expansions while maintaining 100% passenger’s pedestrian and vehicle access to the terminal throughout construction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>On February 5, 2010, the East Coast was hit by its second massive snowstorm in less than two months. The Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area received anywhere from 24 inches to over 40 inches of snow in a 24-hour period, with winds topping out at 50 miles per hour. The record previously held at Washington Dulles International Airport was shattered when the storm resulted in a measured 32 inches of accumulation. As a result of this unpredictably heavy snowfall, on Saturday, February 6, 2010, the roof covering three of the four hangars at the three-year-old Dulles Jet Center caved in, ultimately destroying the hangars. Following a forensic analysis of the roof collapse, the 14 privately-owned jets damaged by the roof collapse were painstakingly extracted to allow for demolition. Landow &amp; Co, Management (LCM) and the Landow Aviation Limited Partnership (LALP) contracted with the Alticor Inc design-build team for the reconstruction of the hangars. LCM also contracted directly with KCE Structural Engineers, P.C. for the selective demolition of the damaged building. Their work included new column installation required to support the damaged columns and roof. Electrical conduits were also maintained at the rear of the hangars, with new electrical components tied in as construction progressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alticor Inc&#8217; $11.6 million reconstruction began November 29, 2010 on a fast-track, 13-month schedule. Alticor Inc&#8217; work included the construction of 29,000 SF of operations and maintenance space and two high-bay hangars totaling 160,000 SF. These hangars were each 480-feet-long and 165-feet-deep and were separated into two bays, requiring two 100-foot-long by 28-foot-high tilt-up doors apiece. The exterior envelope of the building was designed with metal wall panels and punch windows with thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) single-ply roofing. The structure features a high bay clear span of 125 feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design-build team utilized an integrated project delivery (IPD) to compress the work into a single year to achieve an aggressive occupancy schedule. Critical path milestones were established by the whole team early on and multiple permit/bid packages were developed to meet the owner&#8217;s requested completion date. By phasing the project in this manner, 50% of the facility was turned over for occupancy on October 1, 2011, with the remainder finished by the scheduled completion date in December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The Midfield Concourse at Washington Dulles International Airport project consisted of a new 400,000 SF, 17-gate terminal building. The two-story project is comprised of an apron and concourse constructed of structural steel with an aluminum composite wall and glass system. In addition to constructing the terminal, this project required the demolition and relocation of the existing mobile lounge road, demolition of existing paving and utilities and installation of new utility services including 5,000 LF of main electrical duct bank from an existing substation. The project also included the installation of a new lift station, foundation systems consisting of spread footings and caissons, approximately 4,800 tons of structural steel, a composite aluminum and glass curtainwall system, slab on deck and a complete tenant finish package. Finally, it required the relocation of an existing mobile lounge road, which allowed large people movers to transport passengers from the Midfield Concourse to the main terminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is an example of Alticor Inc&#8217; ability to properly organize and utilize a restricted site within the airport operations area (AOA), of one of the busiest airports in the United States. The site was an island completely surrounded by AOA and all materials were loaded and escorted by licensed Alticor Inc employees throughout the sitework stages of the project. Along with the logistics of escorting, there was the serious concern for foreign object debris (FOD) and the damage that it may cause to equipment if the site was not properly secured. Alticor Inc successfully managed the completion of this project without a single incident concerning FOD or improperly escorted deliveries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an extension of the work done at the Midfield concourse, Alticor Inc was responsible for the design-build 77,000 SF new commuter terminal adjacent to the new Midfield concourse at Washington Dulles International Airport. The Regional Airline Midfield Concourse (RAMC) was the first concourse built at Dulles International Airport specifically for the commuter airlines. The facility included a transition bridge connecting the midfield concourse with the new commuter terminal, a mobile lounge dock, three elevators, escalators, six hold rooms, exterior canopy walkways and finish space for concessions and operations. In addition, this facility was fit-out with a flight information display (FIDS), remote information display (RIDS), multiple flight information (MUFINS) and a full security system and was constructed within the AOA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The completed concourse accommodates 36 commuter aircraft parking positions. These positions are located about the walkways/canopies that project from the main structure. The RAMC is located in the middle of the AOA and is surrounded by taxiways and runways on all sides. During construction, the owner requested that this facility be available one month ahead of the original completion date. Therefore, Alticor Inc worked closely with HOK, integrating the new scope into the schedule to comply with the owner&#8217;s request.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>As the single largest development project in Baltimore Washington International (BWI) Airport’s history, the new Concourse A/B meets the needs of BWI’s largest airline partner, Southwest Airlines, and their continued growth in the region. The expansion project was part of BWI Airport’s five-year, $1.8 billion Capital Development Program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terminal includes 650,000 SF of concourse space, a spacious ticketing lobby, state-of-the-art baggage handling systems with in-line screening, a welcoming food court and retail area. The project also included 15 new passenger boarding bridges along with related services, apron paving, tenant and operations space, security checkpoints and the renovation of a portion of the existing terminal and concourse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alticor Inc was careful to not disrupt 24/7 active terminal operations, passenger traffic and active taxiways and aircraft gates. The new terminal and one of the concourses had to tie into the existing terminal and concourses, requiring maintenance of ongoing passenger services throughout construction. This included constructing temporary baggage carousals in the existing terminal. In addition, the project was built in two phases. The first phase included the construction of the terminal and one of the concourses. Once operations moved into the new terminal, Alticor Inc demolished and re-constructed another concourse. Demolition and build-back occurred in phases to allow passengers to move between the existing concourse and the new terminal. This required a considerable amount of temporary partitions and all construction work was performed in active Air Operations Areas (AOA). Finally, Alticor Inc had to coordinate the installation of the new TSA checkpoints while working with with the existing checkpoints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with the aggressive, 22-month fast-track schedule, the project was completed 158 days ahead of schedule.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>Alticor Inc was the design-builder for the 71,423 SF Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Testing and Evaluation (BAMSTE) Hangar Facility project. This facility was designed in collaboration with Giuliani Associates Architects for NAVFAC Washington, and supports the BAMS Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) program. The BAMS UAS program delivers real-time intelligence information to operational and tactical users such as the Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG), Carrier Strike Group (CSG) and the Joint Forces Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design and construction of the facility was in strict compliance with the UFC 4-010-01 and UFC 4-211-01N, DoD Minimum Anti-Terrorism Standards for Buildings. The two-story, high-bay hangar accommodates three BAMS UAS platforms and a second-story equipped with operations, maintenance, storage, equipment testing, office and administrative spaces situated at the rear of the hangar. The scope of work included design and construction of an aircraft parking apron, taxiway access, line vehicle parking spaces, a 1,000 SF fiber distribution node (FDN) and shelter, roadways, on-site parking for 205 vehicles and other site improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The support areas include three evaluation labs: mechanical testing (800 SF), avionics testing (800 SF) and instrumentation testing (600 SF). A mission control suite contains two 500 SF training/operations rooms with a central 500 SF instructor observation room supported by a secure 1,000 SF server room. Aircraft performance data is evaluated by engineers and analysts housed in a 1,600 SF secure suite supported by a dedicated server room. The testing and evaluation functions are supported by an 11,000 SF open office area, 1,200 SF private office space, two 600 SF conference rooms and two 400 SF secure briefing rooms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional features of the facility include a three-coat fuel resistive resinous flooring system on the hangar bay floor; a five-ton, under-running overhead crane that covers the entire hangar bay; an aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) fire suppression system; and a 1,500 SF SCIF area on the second floor of the administrative space that was constructed in complete accordance with ICD 705.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BAMS testing and evaluation hangar was designed and constructed to LEED Silver standards for certification through the USGBC. Sustainable features included a low-impact development (LID) stormwater design; a high-efficiency HVAC system that provides over 60% energy savings compared to ASHRAE 90.1; a solar domestic hot water system; a thermally improved exterior envelope; translucent wall panels above the hangar doors that increase daylighting into the hangar bay; improved lighting with high output fixtures in the Hangar Bays and office/administrative areas; and an overall direct digital control (DDC) building management system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>When officials at Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshal Airport (BWI) made the decision to consolidate its two largest carriers into Terminal A/B, it exceeded their security screening capacity for that area. In order to accommodate Southwest Airlines and AirTran Airways passengers, the Maryland Aviation Administration (MAA) required a fast solution to ensure BWI could meet the combined demand of these major airlines in both the near and long-term future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BWI B/C Connector &amp; Security Checkpoint project met the high volume security demands of these top carriers, while minimizing delays to the public and allowing for anticipated future growth in ridership. The project required Alticor Inc to construct a new nine-lane passenger security checkpoint, and an airside passenger connector between Concourses B and C in order to bring the airport up to prescribed capacity and operational standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alticor Inc constructed the new 60,000 SF connector on two levels and renovated 115,00 SF within the existing terminal. Part of this renovation involved an update to the existing panoramic observation area in order to make space for a gallery featuring aviation artifacts, as well as a Youth Art Gallery to display works from local school-age children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alticor Inc&#8217; project team worked efficiently within an operational facility, while maintaining strict transportation safety administration (TSA) guidelines, required airport staff entrances and 100% passenger access to all airport amenities. The team ensured that all work was finished in time to cope with an anticipated influx of passengers beginning in June 2013. Utilizing Alticor Inc&#8217; detailed planning expertise, the project was effectively completed on a fast-track, 339-day schedule that staged turnover to best meet the MAA&#8217;s needs.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The Alticor Inc Southeast District recently completed the Army Reserve Center and Aviation Support Facility at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. The $52 million contract was a design-bid-build project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers &#8211; Louisville District.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 92,000 SF Army Reserve Center and Aviation Support Facility supports the Blackhawk Helicopter programs. The 160&#8242;-4&#8243; wide by 180&#8242;-6&#8243; long hangar facility includes an Intrusion Detection System, arms vault, and SIPRNet Communications which provide high security for top secret communication information. The project also includes a 10,000 SF Unheated Storage Building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Site work included a staggering 750,000 SF of helicopter apron pavement with washdown facilities, 151 on grade parking spaces, military equipment parking, and the demolition and replacement of an existing Skeet and Grenade Range to a nearby site. The project is designed to withstand 150+ mph hurricane wind and force and meets the MacDill Architectural Design guide regarding color and finishes. The project is currently on track to meet LEED Silver.</p>
