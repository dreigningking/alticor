										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The new Harbor-UCLA Medical Center Redevelopment Program will consolidate medical services into new facilities on the 72-acre campus and ensure Harbor-UCLA Medical Center complies with Senate Bill 1953, which takes effect in 2030 and requires all California hospitals to be structurally resilient in the event of a major earthquake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The project consists of new construction of a 545,000 SF acute care inpatient tower with 346 beds, a helicopter landing pad and a warehouse; a 370,000 SF outpatient treatment and support building and 508,000 SF above-grade parking structure; a 23,000 SF facilities and IT support building, a 34,000 SF regional laboratory building and a new 11,000 SF central plant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Consolidating inpatient and outpatient services into new buildings that optimize operational effectiveness, the project will reduce operation and maintenance costs, provide outpatient facilities that accommodate planned patient visits, implement Los Angeles County’s LEED requirements by incorporating sustainable design features and create a campus designed for the well-being of patients and staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Requiring LEED Gold certification, the medical center upgrade will develop a modern campus that serves the community’s healthcare needs while also aiming to protect the environment in which it is built.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">The City of Hope Orange County comprehensive cancer campus at Irvine’s FivePoint Gateway is being developed in partnership with FivePoint, an owner and developer of large mixed-use, master-planned communities in California. The cancer campus will bring highly specialized care, clinical trials, precision medicine and early detection closer to home. Housed on 11 acres, it will include Orange County’s only specialty hospital exclusively focused on treating and curing cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new City of Hope Orange County project will include the following:<br />
&#8211; An outpatient center offering diagnostic imaging and screenings, precision medicine and early detection, medical oncology, etc.<br />
&#8211; A clinical research center offering phase I-III clinical trials.<br />
&#8211; Personalized supportive care services, upheld as a model for other institutions across the country, to address physical and emotional issues that can arise during treatment.<br />
&#8211; Access to a wide range of solid tumor and blood cancer specialists dedicated to finding the best treatments for each patient.<br />
&#8211; Additional clinical locations that will provide medical oncology and infusion services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Outpatient Building (OSHPD 3) will be built out in an existing 191,000 gross square foot, four stories, core and shell office building. The primary services of this center are subspecialty cancer exams and treatment, a research center and ambulatory surgery. The specialty hospital (OSHPD 1) of 120 beds will be newly constructed adjacent to this existing structure. In addition, two parking structures to support these buildings are to be constructed. The construction of the specialty hospital is currently anticipated to start after the opening of the Outpatient Building due to design and permitting timelines for this OSHPD project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">This history-making temporary COVID-19 testing facility was completed in two months. Six Alticor Inc offices combined efforts, including Southern California, Northern California, Pacific Northwest, Plains, Western and Alticor Inc Services, to design, demolish and procure this project for the Department of General Services during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order to help California build out its laboratory capabilities and expedited efforts by the Department of General Services and the Department of Public Health to increase the state’s COVID-19 testing capacity. The new COVID testing facility was originally contracted to process 100,000 COVID-19 tests per day. However, on the first day of the project, California Governor Gavin Newsom released a public statement saying the test facility would be able to process up to 150,000 COVID-19 diagnostic tests a day, with a contractual turnaround time of 24-48 hours. The project team, originally slated to design a facility for 100,000 daily tests, was able to add an additional 50% capacity for only 10% more of the contract value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The testing laboratory, built in conjunction with major diagnostics company PerkinElmer, began processing tests in November of 2020 and was at full capacity of 150,000 tests in early 2021. The new laboratory reduced the State of California’s turnaround time for COVID-19 tests and created hundreds of new California jobs. The project was constructed on budget and schedule.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Oral Health Clinic is a $12,000,000 renovation project within an existing facility. This 40,000 SF project facilitates the start of the first dental school program within the Texas Tech University System. This project consists of 145 dental operatories with state-of-the-art dental equipment, support spaces for faculty and staff, central sterilization/clean rooms and administrative support spaces for clinical staff. Alticor Inc installed both a Watts One Flow water treatment system and a Chem Aqua RO water system to support the sterilization and decontamination areas.</p>
<p>Construction for this project took place inside an existing warehouse that was re-skinned and partially renovated under a separate contract. The facility will house the dental clinic for the next 5-10 years. After that time, the university plans to build a dedicated facility for the dental school, and ultimately repurpose this building. Based on this premise, all design decisions were made according to future planning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The Grandview Medical Office Building project entailed two projects: the core and shell and the tenant improvement (TI) with repeat client, UCHealth, as the primary tenant. The core and shell part of the project consisted of building a 65,000 SF, three-story medical office building on a seven-acre site with two stairwells, a central elevator core area with two hydraulic elevators, electrical rooms, IT rooms and restrooms. The structure was a conventional build consisting of caissons with pier caps, slab-on-grade, steel structure with composite concrete and metal deck. The sitework included 338 parking spaces, ADA parking spaces, bicycle racks, snowmelt system, irrigation, landscaping, retention pond and a 25-foot-high retaining wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 40,990 SF TI project constructed five clinic spaces that were built-out within the medical office building’s core and shell space. Each space specialized in a different type of care including: imaging, orthopedics, primary care, multi-specialty and rehabilitation space.</p>

<p>The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) League City Expansion Phase II project is an $83 million hospital expansion, broadening healthcare access for neighboring gulf coast communities. The new five-story patient tower features several new departments and amenities encompassing 60 new patient beds, lab spaces and an adjacent helipad. A great deal of coordination was necessary to avoid impacting ongoing operations, requiring the project team to remain flexible and adjust to changing needs. The tower was designed to support a future vertical expansion—up to 12 floors and 360 hospital beds.</p>
