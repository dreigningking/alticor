										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The 860,000 SF McGregor Square project is a vibrant mixed-use development located adjacent to Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies in downtown Denver. This fast-track, Construction Management at Risk project showcased Alticor Inc’ expertise at managing a project while collaborating with the architect, Stantec, to deliver a landmark project to the Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, Ltd.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">McGregor Square is comprised of three towers (office, hospitality and residential) and a two-story below-grade parking garage, as well as retail and restaurant space on the ground floor. This “Gateway to the Ballpark” includes 230,000 SF of office space spread across 11 stories and 175,000 SF of residential space spread across 13 stories. The residential space consists of 105 high-end condominiums and a rooftop pool, amenity deck and fitness room located on the bridge. In addition, McGregor Square includes 156,000 SF of hotel space spread across 13 stories with 176 hotel rooms, 71,000 SF of retail space including the future Rockies Hall of Fame and 196,000 SF of parking with 402 parking spaces.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nestled in between the towers, the 58,000 SF plaza will serve as a year-round outdoor entertainment area, which features a 20-foot by 60-foot big screen that extends the game day experience to the facility. This project is the ninth building in the world registered by the WELL Community Building Standard upon completion. The project team achieved WELL certification for the residential portion of the building and WELL Community certification for the plaza portion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The new, upscale Archer Hotel is located in the business district of Tysons Corner, Virginia. The hotel is the seventh location of the boutique Archer Hotel brand and is part of the planned eight million square foot Scotts Run development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new, seven-story, 181,449 SF Archer Hotel includes 178 rooms, 8,795 SF of restaurant and retail space and 9,209 SF of amenity space. Amenities include private meeting space on the mezzanine level, event space on the first and seventh floors, an exercise room, a marketplace, an upscale restaurant, covered patios and a roof-top terrace and bar. The hotel also includes 64 parking spaces on two levels of below-grade parking totaling 35,036 SF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A unique feature of the hotel is its intricate façade which includes brick, curtainwall and metal panels. The façade required extensive coordination to properly execute the complex interface between several material types while maintaining weatherproofing integrity. Its unique composition includes five brick types, five metal panel types and three types of glass. The glass consists of curtainwall ribbons, storefront sections on the first floor and steel replica windows for meeting spaces on the perimeter of the building. Alticor Inc held early design review meetings with the owner, trade partners and a third-party consultant to thoroughly understand and carefully detail the relationship between all the varied material types. In addition, Alticor Inc and trade partners constructed mock-ups at the off-site staging area to identify risks, troubleshoot and determine the best sequence for installing the exterior skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another unique aspect of the hotel is the rooftop terrace and bar. The terrace features a structural timber frame roof which spans the width of the terrace and is composed of glulam beams from Minnesota. Due to site constraints and the lack of laydown area, the delivery of each beam was carefully scheduled and erection and installation was meticulously sequenced over the span of five weeks. In addition, the timber is supported by concrete and steel structural elements which remain exposed and part of the interior design. The interface between these three structural elements required careful coordination and attention to detail to ensure proper installation while preserving aesthetic quality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About The Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Alticor Inc was the primary general contractor for Universal Orlando’s brand-new resort, Aventura Hotel in Orlando, Florida. Located on Universal Orlando property, adjacent to Sapphire Falls Resort, Cabana Bay Resort, Volcano Bay water park. This beautiful 17-story iconic building can be easily be spotted while driving down I-4 or while enjoying Universal Orlando’s many parks, restaurants, and amenities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The project broke ground in early 2017 and included site work, utilities, hardscape, landscape and hotel construction. Coordination on site was crucial since the new tower was surrounded by I-4 (the most dangerous highway in America), two active hotels, a water park, and connected to a new five-story parking garage that was built concurrently. During crucial build times, Hurricane Irma made land fall in the late 2017. Despite the aftermath causing a two-week delay of work, the Aventura Hotel project team quickly dusted off their boots and were still able to reach the milestone topping out date in December 2017. This fast-tracked project went from the 1st floor to the 10th level deck in just five months and topped out in 11 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Aventura Hotel is Universal Orlando’s first stand-alone, high-rise hotel and is the tallest hotel on Universal property. The new hotel topped out at 17-stories, with 403,000 SF just under $113 Million. The 600 guestrooms, including 13 kids’ suites, provide an excellent sanctuary from the excitement of the parks, with modern finishes that emphasize calming, natural colors, and plenty of light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Other amenities on the property include a pool with an outdoor bar, hot tub spa, splash pad, fire pit, fitness center, a game room with VR experiences, a fast-casual food hall with five different cuisine options, and a rooftop bar with panoramic views of Universal and Downtown Orlando.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Alticor Inc began construction in February of 2017. Construction quickly progressed with a tight 18-month schedule and the building was successfully completed in July 2018 just in time for the hotel to welcome their first guests in August 2018.</p>

<p>The Rosewood Parking Garage project is a $15.4 million, three-level below grade parking garage located at the prestigious Mansion on Turtle Creek Hotel in Dallas, Texas. The 270-space, cast-in-place structure will primarily be reserved for hotel valet and employee parking. The parking garage features a swimming pool at the top deck, a 7,000-SF synthetic grass system, laser-cut custom wrought iron gates, and integral colored concrete. Since opening its doors 36 years ago, the Mansion on Turtle Creek has been a favorite luxury hotel to Dallas’ most affluent business guests and tourists. To keep up with visitor demands, the hotel selected Alticor Inc to construct the 102,000 SF parking garage along with an amenity deck on the north side of the building. Construction began in December 2016 and was completed in May 2018.</p>

<p>The Columbia Place project in Washington, D.C. includes a 244,000 SF Class A residential apartment building and a 422,000 SF 4-Star, dual-brand (Marriott Residence Inn and Marriott Courtyard) convention center hotel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apartment complex features 34 studio units, 143 one-bedroom units and 37 two-bedroom units. The 504-key hotel consists of 357 Courtyard and 147 Residence Inn rooms by Marriott. Associated on-site amenities include a ground floor terrace, rooftop terrace, a rooftop pool and deck, pool locker rooms, indoor and outdoor recreation space, hardscape and landscape features, fitness center and bicycle storage. 21,500 SF of meeting space, a full service restaurant and lobby bar and 1,600 SF of retail are located in the hotel. The projects share a two-level, below-grade parking structure.</p>
<div class="ng-scope">
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>​One of the key project aspects was the incorporation of historical row houses and buildings. A civil war era townhouse, dubbed “The 911 Building,” was moved along a 40 foot skate system and incorporated into the hotel as a high-end board meeting room. Six other townhouses maintained their historical facades and were incorporated into the design as hospitality suites and restaurants. Incorporating these older buildings into the new construction recognizes and focuses on the deep culture and historical significance of the Shaw DC area.</p>
