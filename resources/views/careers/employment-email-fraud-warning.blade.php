                <p>Alticor Inc has been advised of fraudulent employment solicitations targeting persons living outside
                    the United States. These unauthorized solicitations involve the fraudulent use of our company name
                    and logo in employment offers and may require you to provide personal information and/or money for
                    visas, work authorizations or other documentation to participate in a fraudulent hiring process that
                    is not directed or authorized by Alticor Inc. Although Alticor Inc’ name, logo, and website appear
                    to be authentic in these solicitations, any information provided and/or promises made or other
                    inducements offered are not authorized by Alticor Inc and are fraudulent.</p>
                <p>In order to counter this fraudulent conduct, Alticor Inc requires individuals who reside outside the
                    United States that are interested in employment opportunities with Alticor Inc to apply for
                    employment ONLY through a job req posted on this <a href="../job-search/index.html">official
                        website</a> and then by following the instructions for the specific job req. We do not accept
                    applications through any other means for persons residing outside of the United States.</p>
                <p><b>Most importantly, Alticor Inc never requires any sort of payment or other remuneration from any
                        applicant as a condition of employment or for any other reason during the hiring process</b>. If
                    you receive correspondence that appears to be from Alticor Inc but contains any of the illegitimate
                    requests referenced above, do not respond.</p>
                <p>If you do encounter one of these improper solicitations Alticor Inc urges that you contact the proper
                    law enforcement authority in your area.</p>
                <p>As always, we encourage qualified applicants to <a href="../job-search/index.html">apply with
                        Alticor Inc</a> via our authorized methods.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
