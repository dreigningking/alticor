                    combination of People, Processes, Partnership, and Technology in real-time collaboration. We plan,
                    build, and manage every aspect of our projects to enhance our standard of care and processes. We
                    collaborate with our project teams, including our owners, to identify opportunities to create
                    efficiencies within our workflow and communications. We do this by leveraging technology to ensure
                    our project teams have access to real-time data, allowing all decisions to be made with the best
                    information possible.</p>

                                    <p>Small Unmanned Aerial Systems are becoming a common tool on Alticor Inc projects.
                                        By integrating this technology into our daily processes we are able to provide
                                        our project teams accurate real time data onsite.Â  This same data allows our
                                        Superintendents to verify excavations quantities, track progress, enhance safe
                                        material handling, site access, and maximize our logistics plans. Our Safety
                                        Managers are able to perform safety inspections with this same technology
                                        helping to make our sites even safer. Once constructed, we are able to capture
                                        as-built conditions and even detect heat loss from the building envelops with
                                        the infrared cameras mounted on the small Unmanned Aerial Systems.<u></u></p>

                                    <p>Alticor Inc through the use of Augmented and Virtual Reality has allowed project
                                        teams to visualize the design overlaid on existing features in its final
                                        intended location on site, which allows for a more immersive viewing
                                        environment. Using Mixed Reality in conjunction with Head Mounted Displays, the
                                        user can experience a hands-free visualization of the model, which in turn
                                        expands the capabilities of workers on site. Project team members including our
                                        owners are able to visualize everything from Operating Rooms to Data Centers
                                        allowing us to get to Design completion much faster than we have in the past.
                                        Once on site we have been able to reduce rework tremendously by validating
                                        install ensuring that all systems are installed in the correct locations the

                                        process and analysis this data is extremely limited and inefficient, we are
                                        looking to leverage Machine and Deep Learning to help us better understand this
                                        data and in real time. With the ability to have the machine recognize the

                                        our project team members the best information possible to make critical
