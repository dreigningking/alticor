                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alticor Inc proudly supports the communities in which we live,
                        build and work. This commitment is demonstrated by our various community service projects and
                        small business development programs over the years — creating relationships with neighborhoods
                        and municipalities across the United States.</span></p>



                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating in food and back-to-school drives, wrapping donated
                        presents for children at the holidays, building homes for the those in need with Habitat for
                        Humanity or Marian Homes, and supporting our nation’s veterans through the Wounded Warrior
                        Project are just a few of the efforts Alticor Inc employees have engaged in this
                        year.&nbsp;Alticor Inc also proudly mentors a future generation of builders through the ACE

                        pre-apprenticeship programs targeting unemployed workers in underserved communities. In
                        recognition of these efforts, we were awarded the Charles A. Horsky Leadership Award.</span></p>



                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alticor Inc’ commitment to small businesses results from our strong
