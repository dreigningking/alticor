                        important part of Alticor Inc’ culture. Promoting a diverse workplace elevates human value and
                        productivity by respecting and utilizing the viewpoints of workers from different backgrounds.
                        We are a committed Equal Opportunity Employer and encourage open dialogue and understanding
                        among our employees. Our workforce diversity allows Alticor Inc to better represent the
                        communities in which we live and work and to ensure that our employees are the best and
                        brightest in the industry.</p>
                    <p>Alticor Inc recognizes that employees need to feel like they belong within an organization.
                        Resource groups, on-going trainings and teambuilding activities create a community environment
                        that welcomes individuals and embraces their differences. Most recently, Alticor Inc created an
                        internal forum dedicated to this important cause, DEIc.</p>

                    <p>In support of its recently launched core values, Alticor Inc launched the Diversity, Equity,
                        Inclusion and community (DEIc) forums, consisting of a core group of volunteers from each
                        district. These forums have been working hard to foster healthy discussions in their districts
                        and develop ideas and trainings to fortify our commitment to diversity and community. These
                        groups support employees in each district, working to maintain internal morale and community
                        ties through outreach, mentoring, recruiting and advancement-related efforts.</p>



                    <p>Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) has awarded Alticor Inc the National Diversity
                        Excellence Award in the General Contractor category nine times since the award’s inception in
                        2012. This national award is judged on the diversity of the company’s own workforce hiring
                        practices, training, and retention, as well as our relationships with small disadvantaged,
                        minority, or women-owned subcontractors and vendors.</p>

                        internally, Alticor Inc supports its employees through programs such as the Women’s Leadership
                        Seminar (WLS), an event designed to bring together women from across the company to learn from
                        one another, share challenges, and explore areas of personal and career growth, as well as WNet,
                        a leadership network of women within the company.</p>
