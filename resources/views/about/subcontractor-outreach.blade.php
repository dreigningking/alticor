                    <div style="grid-column: 1 / 2;">Alticor Inc is dedicated to small business outreach and achieving the
                        highest possible level of diverse business on each of the projects our company undertakes. As a
                        leading general contractor within the industry, it is important that we set an example. Our
                        professionals are accountable for the implementation of this corporate commitment and work hard to
                        customize an overall outreach plan to reach small and emerging businesses in our preconstruction,
                        purchasing, and construction efforts. Not only do we host and attend outreach events for the small
                        business community, but we also solicit opportunities for these contractors. We help them work more
                        efficiently internally and with larger subcontractors — small businesses through prequalification,
                        and creating, managing and unbundling (when feasible) scopes of work to attract the best
                        opportunities. Alticor Inc also holds numerous networking events related to existing and upcoming
                        procurements. These events are designed to reach out to local small business communities, elected
                        officials, and the surrounding neighborhoods as a whole.</div>
