<p><strong>About Trade Partner Appreciation Week</strong></p>



<p>In 2022, the Mid Atlantic District Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and community (DEIc) forum identified a need to better support, honor and celebrate our trade partner community. As a result, the district created Trade Partner Appreciation Week, held from September 19 – 23. Jobsites were encouraged to recognize their project and small business successes, recognize project employees and host a BBQ to present jobsite awards. The week culminated in the inaugural Trade Partner Appreciation Awards luncheon.</p>

In conjunction with the City of Fort Lauderdale, USA DIVING and Red Bull Cliff Diving, the aquatic center hosted a media day to highlight all aspects of the new dive tower and the facets of diving as a sport.</p>



<p>World champion high diver Steven LoBue and 2020 Olympian Brandon Loschiavo, along with members of the Fort Lauderdale Dive Team, USA Diving’s High-Performance Squad and Red Bull Cliff Diving were in attendance for the media day event. Steven LoBue became the first person to dive off of the new 27-meter tower, the first of its kind in the western hemisphere.</p>



<p>The 27-meter dive tower includes nine platform levels and combines three sporting events: springboard (one-meter, three-meter), platform diving (one-meter, three-meter, five-meter, seven-point-five-meter, 10-meter) and high diving (15-meter, 20-meter, 24-meter and 27-meter). The tower is constructed of 96 precast concrete panels and rests on a foundation five-feet deep and 53-feet wide, supported by 35 auger cast piles at a depth of 60-feet. There are 162 stairs to the top of the tower.</p>

<p>July 1, 2021 marked a major milestone for the City of Fort Lauderdale as its new dive tower was officially topped off. Alticor Inc placed the final precast crown for the Fort Lauderdale Aquatic Center 27-meter dive tower, reaching its height of 101 feet above grade. This is another of many firsts for the City of Fort Lauderdale, having built the first Olympic-Sized swimming pool in the state of Florida in 1928, followed by the iconic Swimming Hall of Fame in 1965.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.henselphelps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dive-Tower-Topping-Out-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11869" width="466" height="621" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dive-Tower-Topping-Out-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dive-Tower-Topping-Out-225x300.jpg 225w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dive-Tower-Topping-Out-300x400.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dive-Tower-Topping-Out-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Dive-Tower-Topping-Out.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /><figcaption>The dive tower at the Fort Lauderdale Aquatic Center took 360 cubic yards of concrete and 160,000 lbs of reinforced steel to build.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The two-day celebration kicked off with the City of Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis, City Commissioners and notable figures in the local and professional swimming community, gathering to dedicate the construction of the world’s first precast 27-meter dive tower. The special guests included World High Diving Champion Steven LoBue, FINA High Diving Technical Committee Chair and Olympian Tom Gompf, USA Diving Olympians Dave Burgering, Michelle Davidson-Sandelin, Randy Ableman and USA National Team Members David Dinsmore, Zac Cooper, Briadam Herrera, and 2021 Swedish Olympian Emma Gullstrand. </p>



<p>The following day, Alticor Inc held a topping off celebration for the project staff with a catered lunch and multiple raffled prizes at the Fort Lauderdale Aquatic Center.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 27-meter dive tower includes nine platform levels and combines three sporting events: springboard (one-meter, three-meter), platform diving (one-meter, three-meter, five-meter, seven-point-five-meter, 10-meter) and high diving (15-meter, 20-meter, 24-meter and 27-meter). The tower is constructed of 96 precast concrete panels and rests on a foundation five-feet deep and 53-feet wide, supported by 35 auger cast piles at a depth of 60-feet. There are 162 stairs to the top of the tower.</p>



<p>The Alticor Inc design-build team was awarded the project in August 2018 and consists of Cartaya &amp; Associates, Counsilman-Husaker, Gate Precast, Weller Pools, Keith &amp; Associates, Langan, WSP, HyPower Inc, Econstruct, Southeast Precast Erectors, and Right Way Plumbing Company. The Fort Lauderdale Aquatic Center is scheduled for substantial completion in September 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Renovations to the aquatic center include the demolition and construction of new swimming pools that will be FINA (Fédération International de Natation) compliant and meet the international swimming and diving competition standards, state-of-the-art 27-meter permanent dive tower, a spa, a new grandstand building and bleachers with spectator restrooms, concessions and a ticket office. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Women’s Construction Industry Reception</strong></p>
<p>The 18<sup>th</sup> annual Women’s Construction Industry Reception (WCIR), hosted by Alticor Inc, adapted to the times with a virtual spotlight of 10 ambitious women in the AEC industry. The WCIR Spotlight features women in Colorado who were nominated by their colleagues for their outstanding achievements.</p>
<p>“I was impressed by the quality of the submissions we received as well as the variety throughout the industry,” commented Katie Himsel, Alticor Inc office engineer and organizer of the Spotlight nominations. “You could tell a lot of time and effort were put into these by strong and passionate women in construction from all different backgrounds and experience levels.”</p>
<p>For the past decade, Alticor Inc has collaborated with industry partners to host this reception, focusing on fostering a self-supporting group of women. The reception promotes networking and a sense of community within the Colorado AEC industry.</p>
<p><strong>Alticor Inc&#8217; W-Net</strong></p>
<p>Alticor Inc Plains District Women&#8217;s Network group (W-Net) organizes the annual WCIR. Since the inception of Alticor Inc&#8217; W-Net over 18 years ago, the mission of the organization has remained unchanged: to recruit, retain and cultivate the skillset of our employees to ultimately improve Alticor Inc as a whole while providing a support system for women to pursue leadership opportunities and promote career growth in the industry. The group has grown from 20 women in 2002 to more than 600 participants across the company today. In the Plains District, W-Net includes more than 40 women.</p>
<p>“W-Net and WCIR have fostered an environment that allows the women in the industry to develop relationships and provides a forum that allows us to support each other as we move through our careers,” remarked Alticor Inc Project Manager Ashleigh Widmier. “It is amazing to see the growth year-to-year in the number of ladies involved in these organizations, as well as the individual growth that each of these ladies is achieving.”</p>
<p>Alticor Inc&#8217; Plains W-Net appreciates the continued support of the WCIR and congratulates the 10 women who were selected for this year&#8217;s Spotlight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><em>Thousands in Southern California receive frozen turkeys for Thanksgiving</em></h4>
<p>RIVERSIDE, CHULA VISTA, and LOS ANGELES, Calif., Nov. 22, 25 &#8211; 26, 2019 ⁠— For the ninth straight year, more than 3,300 frozen turkeys were distributed across Southern California by Alticor Inc with generous support provided by trade and community partners. The annual turkey giveaway and canned food drive are part of Alticor Inc&#8217; ongoing mission to give back to the communities they build in.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9004" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9004" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9004 size-medium" src="https://www.henselphelps.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2578_WEBSITE-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2578_WEBSITE-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2578_WEBSITE-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2578_WEBSITE.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9004" class="wp-caption-text">2019 Alticor Inc Southern California District Annual Turkey Giveaway in Los Angeles, California</figcaption></figure></p>
<h5><strong>Community Partners</strong></h5>
<p>The annual turkey giveaway is made possible with the generous community partners and non-profit organizations of <a href="https://rchf.org/">Riverside Community Health Foundation-Community Settlement Association</a>, <a href="https://sdsuwic.org/">Chula Vista Research Foundation’s Women Infant &amp; Children (WIC)</a>, <a href="http://www.parentsofwatts.org/index.php">Parents of Watts</a>, <a href="http://www.faithinspirational.org/">Faith Inspirational Church</a>, <a href="https://www.2ndcall.org/">2nd Call</a>, and <a href="http://www.pvjobs.org/">PVJOBS</a>.</p>
<p>“The relationships and partnerships that Alticor Inc has in the local Southern California communities are special,” says Damian Buessing, Vice President and District Manager at Alticor Inc. “Our Annual Turkey Giveaway brings everyone together for a great cause and allows us to see firsthand the overwhelming joy this tradition brings.”</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9005" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9005" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-9005" src="https://www.henselphelps.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6194_WEBSITE-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6194_WEBSITE-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6194_WEBSITE-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_6194_WEBSITE.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9005" class="wp-caption-text">2019 Alticor Inc Southern California District Annual Turkey Giveaway in Chula Vista, California</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The Alticor Inc Turkey Giveaways and Canned Food Drives are strategically planned to assist local disadvantaged Southern California families in offsetting the costs associated with preparing a holiday meal. “Our goal is to provide folks in our community the opportunity to celebrate Thanksgiving with their families and loved ones with food on the table,” says Scott Berg, General Superintendent. “Participating in this event gives one a greater sense of what Thanksgiving is all about.”</p>
<h5><strong>Six Locations Across Southern California</strong></h5>
<p>For three days, excited volunteers collected, counted, bagged, and prepared frozen turkeys along with canned foods and dry grains that were distributed at six different geographic locations across the cities of Riverside, Chula Vista, and Los Angeles County.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_9006" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9006" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9006 size-medium" src="https://www.henselphelps.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1Q8A6806-2_WEBSITE-300x200.jpg" alt="2019 Alticor Inc Southern California District Annual Turkey Giveaway in Riverside, California" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1Q8A6806-2_WEBSITE-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1Q8A6806-2_WEBSITE-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1Q8A6806-2_WEBSITE.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9006" class="wp-caption-text">2019 Alticor Inc Southern California District Annual Turkey Giveaway in Riverside, California</figcaption></figure></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixteen small business trade partners recently attended the fourth <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/subcontractor-outreach/">Technical Assistance Program (TAP)</a> presentation, delivered by Alticor Inc&#8217; Mid Atlantic District in Tysons Corner, VA. Launched in 2016, TAP provides small business trade partners guidance in working with Alticor Inc, preparing them for future growth. Topics covered in this annual presentation include procurement, estimating, safety, quality control, project management, and Virtual Design &amp; Construction (VDC).</p>
<p>Following the presentation, Alticor Inc asked participants to share their top takeaways from this year&#8217;s program. Here is what they had to say.</p>
<p><strong>Building Relationships</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the program, presenters stressed the importance of building relationships with the right people. Alticor Inc has strong relationships with the trade partner community, both large and small, across the nation. These relationships have been developed through years of treating companies and individuals as partners rather than subcontractors. This unique quality resonated with Camille Scott of Camille Scott Interior Design and Renovations: “It is important for me to continue building relationships and network with the right businesses for me to move into the commercial world, rather than just residential work. One of the reasons I attended TAP is because I am looking to partner with Alticor Inc to help me gain traction in the industry.”</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Be Afraid to Say No</strong></p>
<p>During Corporate Director of Supplier Diversity Brad Lewis’ presentation, he stated that it is important for small business trade partners to be transparent about their capacity and capabilities. Small businesses should be setting realistic goals for growth, which may require them to say “no” to some opportunities. As Katrina Lyles of D2 LLC noted, “If Alticor Inc gave me work, I’d be excited, and I’d want to keep saying ‘yes’ to more work. But, if I can’t handle that work, it may eventually compromise the quality of the work and, in turn, the relationships I have built with Alticor Inc.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-8959" src="https://www.henselphelps.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0859_for-web.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="245" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0859_for-web.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0859_for-web-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DSC_0859_for-web-768x509.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></p>
<p><strong>Get Certified – And Stay Certified</strong></p>
<p>Proper certification will always set a small business apart on bid day. “On bid day, if we have a small business and a certified small business, both with the same verified scope and comparable price, we will choose the certified small business because they bring added value,” said Brad Lewis of Alticor Inc. With so many certification options available, including Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned Small Business, HUBZone-Owned Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, and Services Disabled Veteran-Owned Small business, there are many ways a small business can bring added value to the team.</p>
<p><strong>Find the Right Fit</strong></p>
<p>As the construction industry becomes more saturated, it is important for small business trade partners to find a general contractor who will work with their capabilities and help them grow. Tisa Clark is President &amp; CEO of J.D. Clark, a small general contractor. For Tisa, attending TAP helped her gain a broad understanding of how Alticor Inc operates across different pillars of the project lifecycle. “As a small general contractor, I wanted to make sure I found the right fit. After this program, I think I found it,” said Clark. Wendy Archer, President and CEO of Groshell Logistics, Inc. echoed these sentiments: “The repeated use of trade partners was genuine. It made me feel like I am joining a new family who will always be there to guide and support me every step of the way! I am very excited to be part of a dynamic group of people.”</p>
<p>As part of the continual effort to build new and effective small business partnerships across the country, Alticor Inc looks forward to future iterations of TAP.  To learn more about TAP, the Emerging 10 and other small business programs that Alticor Inc offers to industry trade partners, visit: <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/subcontractor-outreach/">https://www.henselphelps.com/subcontractor-outreach/.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Dressed up in Costumes, Golfers Participate in 18-Hole Scramble to Benefit Three Local Southern California Charities</h4>
<p>One hundred thirty-two golfers and over 60 Alticor Inc volunteers teed off for a cause at the Maderas Golf Club in Poway, California, on October 31, 2019. The 4<sup>th</sup> Annual Alticor Inc Halloween Charity Golf Tournament, presented by title sponsor <a href="https://floodpeterson.com/">Flood &amp; Peterson</a>, was made possible by generous support from all participants, which helped raise over $120,000. Proceeds from the event will benefit the La Jolla Family House in San Diego, the Ronald McDonald House Charities of San Diego, and UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge based in Irvine, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Alticor Inc Annual Halloween Charity Golf Tournament is close to my heart and a great event that brings our trade partners and clients together to help local charities while dressing up in your favorite costume &#8211; and oh yeah &#8211; play golf! A special thanks to all the sponsors, volunteers, and fellow team members to make this all happen,” said Rob Muellner, Alticor Inc Project Manager.</p>
<h5><strong>Major Sponsors</strong></h5>
<p>In addition to Flood &amp; Peterson, other major sponsors included ACCO Engineered Systems, Berg Electric, Brady SoCal, Inc., California Sheet Metal, Christian Brothers Flooring &amp; Interiors, Cosco Fire Protection, Inc., Dynalectric, Helix Electric Inc., ISEC, Inc., Morrow-Meadows, Pacific Coast Glazing, Inc., Pacific Coast Iron, and Rossin Steel Inc.</p>
<h5><strong>Full Coverage</strong></h5>
<p>Alticor Inc stayed true to its mission of hosting a complete player experience. Greeted with breakfast burritos, coffee, and a Bloody-Mary bar, the volunteers and golfing participants arrived before sunrise decked out in Halloween costumes ranging from Oktoberfest to Star Wars and everything in between. As the participants made their way through the Halloween themed registration entrance, they were given generous vouchers for Adidas and Titleist swag, where hundreds of different golf items available such as jackets, golf bags, socks, and hats were on display. Each participant received a goody-bag with <a href="https://www.stance.com/">Stance</a> socks, <a href="https://www.everydaycalifornia.com/">Everyday California</a> branded hats, t-shirts and beach towels, and multiple sleeves of new golf balls.</p>
<p>Executive Director, Anti-Cancer Challenge, Jennifer Sarrail, said, “We are grateful to be beneficiaries of the annual Alticor Inc golf tournament. The generous companies and individuals playing today contributed to the exploration of innovative approaches to cancer treatment at the UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Many thanks to Alticor Inc for giving us this opportunity and for supporting the UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge since our first event in 2017.”</p>
<p>The participants teed off at 8:00 a.m. Along the eighteen holes were themed and interactive stations where golfers could get to know Alticor Inc employees and charity personnel and participate in an array of activities that included a Masters themed hole, frisbee golf, camouflage-themed nerf gun competition, dice games, soccer and football games, life-sized golf pong, and a TrackMan radar system setup that tracked specific measurements to accurately identify the impact and ball flight conditions for each player&#8217;s shot.</p>
<p>“The La Jolla Family House at UC San Diego Health is thrilled and grateful to be one of the beneficiaries of the Alticor Inc Halloween Golf Tournament. This is by far the most delightful and creative golf tournament in San Diego,” said Denise M. Capozzi, Director at UC San Diego Health Bannister Family House.</p>
<p>Prizes were given for Best Team Halloween Costumes (Grand Prize), Longest Drive and Closest to the Pin contests, Best Overall score, the Most Honest (worst) score, Highest Velocity Swing, and Lowest Velocity Swing. Alticor Inc held a raffle, offering 40-prizes with a value of over $10,000.</p>
<p>“Alticor Inc put on an incredible day at their annual Halloween golf tournament, and we were honored to be chosen as a beneficiary. We are grateful to their support of San Diego’s Ronald McDonald House and the families who rely on our services,” said Chuck Day, president and CEO of Ronald McDonald House Charities of San Diego. “Their community support is critical to ensuring families have the care and support they need, whether it’s a comfortable place to sleep, a warm meal, or an understanding hug. Keeping families close during this critical time is essential, and Alticor Inc is helping make that possible,” Chuck Day, Ronald McDonald House Charities of San Diego President and CEO.</p>
<p>A heartfelt thank-you goes out to the sponsors and volunteers who helped make the 4<sup>th</sup> Annual Halloween Charity Golf Tournament a successful and exciting fundraising event.</p>
