<p>Alticor Inc announces the launch of <a href="https://www.diverge.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diverge</a>, an investment company specializing in construction innovation and technology. Diverge is a new company within Alticor Inc that works directly with innovation partners and technology startups to source, evaluate, invest and deploy new construction innovations.</p>



<p>Emerging construction building methods and technologies in the ConTech space have the potential to transform the building process. Technologies from small startups continually push the envelope, making complex processes intuitive with easy-to-use systems that improve communication and make building more efficient. Diverge provides a platform for Alticor Inc to engage with these technology companies and assist in developing new solutions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Over the past decade, we have seen continual advancement in prefabrication, robotics, drones, and many other technology platforms that are having a profound impact on how we deliver projects. Diverge provides Alticor Inc a structured approach to evaluate and implement innovation in our business,” said Brad Jeanneret, executive vice president. “We are investing in the future of our industry.” </p></blockquote>



<p>By investing in these startups and their products in the early stages of development, Alticor Inc can help influence construction technology in a positive way, creating success for both companies as well as the AEC industry. Technology firms working with Alticor Inc benefit equally by leveraging the diversity of Alticor Inc’ business, allowing their products to be tested in real-life scenarios and evaluated directly by the target audience—the construction professional.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Introducing Diverge - Rethinking Innovation" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB0NUe2v4nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“The greatest benefit in our relationship with Alticor Inc has been the acceleration in learning,” said N K Chaitanya with technology company, ConstructN.ai. “The interactions with various domain experts across different offices and different types of projects has helped us immensely in prioritizing our roadmap and accelerate product market fit. This level of discovery and support helps us understand the problems, along with the severity and complexity in the way it is being solved. We now have a well-defined roadmap, and as we start working on the pilot projects, we believe will be well placed to deliver better value faster.”</p>



<p>Alticor Inc employees are eager to give constructive feedback about the products they are using, knowing they are contributing to the end result, a technology that will help make their day-to-day more efficient and effective.</p>



<p>“Alticor Inc is always looking for technology that will take our safety program to the next level,” said Alticor Inc Corporate Director of Safety and Health Jerry Shupe. “Often times, we experience products that were built with construction as an afterthought or a solution that only addresses a portion of our needs. By working with these technology companies in the early stages of development, we are able to deliver results that not only enhance our existing programs, but also allow for flexibility in our dynamic industry. We are able to create products our people want to use and integrate safety into a variety of solutions that result in overall efficiency and a safer job site.</p>



<p>The construction industry is experiencing considerable digital disruption, robotics integration, prefabrication solutions and many more innovative solutions to advance the industry. The $1.6 trillion dollar US construction industry is the second least digitized among all industries. Alticor Inc leverages their people, processes and partnerships as a catalyst for innovation.</p>



<p>Having already spent his tenure at Alticor Inc working alongside construction technology startups, innovation leader Thai Nguyen, was eager to formalize an already successful program. “For over a decade, we have been partnering with early startups and strategic partners with much success.&nbsp; The unique journeys, transparency, symbiotic relationships and invaluable insights have been consistent pillars, allowing Alticor Inc to push the boundaries of innovation,” said Thai. “Culturally, we no longer have to pull our people towards innovation and technology. Instead, our everyday innovators are pushing and not settling for the status quo.”</p>



<p>Diverge’s team and growing list of partners is focused on identifying and evaluating solutions that have the potential to break through and advance how the industry plans, builds and manages construction projects. Construction innovators are encouraged to pitch their industry-changing ideas to Diverge, which is currently accepting new submissions for evaluation.</p>

<p>Established by Congress in 1999, May is nationally recognized as Military Appreciation Month. In honor of their service and sacrifice, Alticor Inc would like to thank all our active, reserve, national guard and veteran service members and their families.</p>



<p>Even when they are no longer in the military, veterans are&nbsp;<em>Always in Uniform.&nbsp;</em>They bring teamwork, integrity and respect into every aspect of their lives, including on the jobsite. They truly embody Alticor Inc’ Core Values and how Building Together creates successful teams and communities.</p>



<p>Alticor Inc is proud to support the ongoing commitments of our National Guard and Reserve employees. We understand their obligations for training. Similar to construction, there is always a need to refresh skills and have up-to-date safety information. Alticor Inc supports these employees during deployments and is proud to welcome them home and work with them to transition back to the jobsite when their deployment ends.​​​​​​​</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Veteran-owned trade partners also play an important role in the make-up of a successful project team. Over the past 10-years, Alticor Inc has directed an average of 10% of their trade partner spend on veteran-owned (VOSB) and service-disabled veteran-owned (SDVOSB) small businesses. Alticor Inc has also been recognized over the years with numerous awards for our support of Guard and Reserve employees and VOSB trade partner engagement.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/hensel-phelps-accepts-2017-secretary-defense-employer-support-freedom-award/">Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award for employers who provide exceptional support to their Guard and Reserve employees</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hensel-phelps-construction-co-_the-employer-support-of-the-guard-reserve-activity-6888118004899561472-dDow?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=android_app">Employer Support for the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) – The Patriot Award, Seven Seals Award and the Above and Beyond Award</a></li><li><a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/hensel-phelps-top-25-best-corporations-veteran-owned-businesses/">Top Corporation for Veteran-Owned Business from National Veteran Owned Business Association</a>​​​​​​​​​​​​​​</li></ul>



<p>Alticor Inc is actively partnered with national programs to hire transitioning military personnel, veterans, members of the National Guard and Reserves, and military spouses. A few of the organizations Alticor Inc is involved with are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://recruitmilitary.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://recruitmilitary.com/">RecruitMilitary</a></li><li><a href="https://skillbridge.osd.mil/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://skillbridge.osd.mil/">DOD SkillBridge</a></li><li><a href="https://www.oriontalent.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.oriontalent.com/">Orion Talent</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hiringourheroes.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hiringourheroes.org/">Hiring Our Heroes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.same.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.same.org/">The Society of American Military Engineers (SAME)</a></li></ul>



<p>In addition to supporting our service members and trade partners, Alticor Inc consistently ranks at the top for government and military construction. These projects, such as the <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/timeline_slider_post/2013-c-5-159th-readiness-center/">Wyoming Military Department C-5/159<sup>th</sup> Readiness Center</a>, <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/army-reserve-center-aviation-support-facility-macdill-afb/">Army Reserve Center and Aviation Support Facility</a>, <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/forscom-usarc-combined-headquarters/">FORSCOM / USARC Combined Headquarters</a>, <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/broken-arrow-armed-forces-reserve-center-aerc/">Broken Arrow Armed Forces Reserve Center</a>, and the <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/pentagon-renovation-wedges-2-5/">Pentagon Renovation</a>, play important role in training and strengthening our armed forces so they can focus on carrying out their jobs. They also help veterans transition to civilian life through programs such as the <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/california-veterans-home-fresno/">California Veterans Home in Fresno</a>.</p>

<p>Join Alticor Inc in taking an opportunity to think about what military appreciation means to you.&nbsp;To help facilitate action and conversation, here are some key dates throughout the month of May that will provide a chance to reflect on those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and to thank our active and veteran service members and their families:</p>



<ul><li><strong>May 6<sup>th</sup></strong>&nbsp;– National Military Spouse Appreciation Day</li><li><strong>May 8<sup>th</sup></strong>&nbsp;– Victory in Europe Day</li><li><strong>May 8<sup>th</sup></strong>&nbsp;– Mother’s Day</li><li><strong>May 13<sup>th</sup></strong>&nbsp;– Children of Fallen Patriots Day</li><li><strong>May 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;</strong>– Armed Forces Day</li><li><strong>May 30<sup>th</sup></strong>– Memorial Day ​​​​​​​</li></ul>



<p>This month we’ll be highlighting the contributions of veterans, National Guard members and Reservists to the AEC industry and their communities, and what Alticor Inc and our employees can and have done to support them, both at work and at home.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“<em>Always in Uniform</em>&nbsp;to me means that no matter where you are or what you are doing, you are representing yourself, your family, your country, the military or even the company you work for.

<p>For decades, Alticor Inc has been committed to small and minority-owned businesses. Rooted in the company’s values, Alticor Inc approach to small business utilization is among the most comprehensive in the industry. They are dedicated to small business outreach and achieving the highest level of diverse businesses on each of the projects the company undertakes.</p>



<p>In honor of Small Business Week, Alticor Inc would like to recognize the thousands of small business partnerships that have been a part of their success. Together, both Alticor Inc and their small business partners have leveraged this success to expand into new markets and regions. These partnerships foster a greater connection with the communities in which we build by providing opportunities for small business participation.</p>



<p>From company leadership to field engineers starting their careers, Alticor Inc reinforces the importance of supporting small businesses. Their people endeavor to establish new partnerships and continue to build on existing small business relationships nationwide.</p>



<p>Alticor Inc has led the industry in designing small business programs that completely transform the relationship between large and small businesses on major construction projects. These efforts have helped small businesses do more than simply survive in the marketplace. Alticor Inc’ small business programs help these companies develop the internal capacity needed to succeed on their own and grow over time. Alticor Inc sees the partnerships with small businesses as an opportunity to create a path to their success. Through programs such as TAP and Head Start Bonding, Alticor Inc helps their small business trade partners overcome challenges and roadblocks to exceed their goals and realize ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In celebration of Women’s History Month, Alticor Inc brings our focus to the influential women who have helped to shape our industry. Since the 13th century, women have been an integral part of the construction labor force and skilled trades. In the 19th century, Emily Warren Roebling took over the management of the Brooklyn Bridge construction after her husband became ill. Her leadership was so impactful to the success of the bridge construction, that she rode with President Chester A. Arthur across the bridge during its official opening.</p>



<p>From the School of Architecture firsts, Ethel Charles and Julia Morgan to Lillian Gilbreth – the first woman to join the American Society of Mechanical Engineers – women make up a significant portion of the design and construction profession. Women continue to shape the industry, moving it forward in many ways including reducing the gender wage gap to one of the narrowest in any industry.</p>



<p>With over twice the national average of women in construction, Alticor Inc celebrates Women’s History Month by sharing the stories of women in both leadership and craft roles. Alticor Inc will also host an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gU8S_ceDyiVEyNKmuTaW5OPiGtAHWTVc/view?usp=sharing" data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gU8S_ceDyiVEyNKmuTaW5OPiGtAHWTVc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-woman live panel</a> featuring those in executive leadership during Women in Construction Week.</p>



<p>Please join Alticor Inc as they strive to build a culture without boundaries, where everyone feels empowered to bring individuality and uniqueness to the construction industry.</p>

<p>In the United States, February is Black History Month, a time for the nation to celebrate and spotlight the heritage of Black Americans. Carter G. Woodson, known as the father of Black history, created the first iteration of Black History Month in February of 1926. Black history month was not observed by much of the nation until 1986 when Congress passed a law establishing National Black History Month.</p>



<p>At Alticor Inc, one of our five core values is Diversity. Alticor Inc embraces this core value as we join the national celebration of Black History Month by highlighting Alticor Inc employee stories, recruiting efforts and trade partner relationships. Throughout this month, these stories will honor and recognize the accomplishments of these individuals and organizations.</p>



<p>Alticor Inc has been acknowledged for our commitment to advance diversity and fostering a culture of inclusion by winning the <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/hensel-phelps-awarded-2020-abc-national-diversity-excellence-award/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.henselphelps.com/hensel-phelps-awarded-2020-abc-national-diversity-excellence-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC National Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Excellence</a> award nine times, as well as the <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/hensel-phelps-awarded-agc-diversity-inclusion-award/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.henselphelps.com/hensel-phelps-awarded-agc-diversity-inclusion-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AGC Diversity and Inclusion Excellence Award</a>. These awards honor the initiatives and programs that Alticor Inc champions.</p>



<p>Alticor Inc will continue encouraging and celebrating the diversity of our people and trade partners. By engaging diverse businesses and providing recruiting opportunities at Historically Black Colleges and Universities or on-campus organizations, such as National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Alticor Inc will build a culture without boundaries where everyone feels empowered to bring individuality and uniqueness to the construction industry.</p>

<p>Created by employees and partners, Building Together is Alticor Inc’ national diversity and inclusion campaign. Building Together highlights the importance of diversity within Alticor Inc and the AEC industry. The campaign gives employees the opportunity to share their stories and learn from each other’s experiences.</p>



<p>Over the next 12 months, Alticor Inc’ Building Together campaign will spotlight individuals and teams from the perspective of diversity and inclusion. Inspired by national events including Black History Month and Pride, as well as industry-focused issues such as women in construction and mental health awareness, the campaign will increase awareness of challenges and opportunities posed to us as we build on our understanding and appreciation of our colleagues.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Building Together is more than just a campaign. It is our way to get to know and understand one another, and to develop deeper relationships with our coworkers and friends alike. There is so much for everyone to learn from this initiative, and we’re only going to come out as a stronger, more cohesive organization.” &#8211; Brad Lewis, Alticor Inc Director of Supplier Diversity</p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to highlighting stories, Alticor Inc will share educational resources, industry thought-leadership articles, events and inspirational words. By featuring voices both within and outside the company, Building Together will highlight the many benefits and advantages of a diverse and inclusive workplace.</p>

</div></figure>



<h4><strong>Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and community</strong> <strong>(DEIc) </strong></h4>



<p>When Alticor Inc shared their vision and core values, the company identified the importance of Diversity and Community to employees and our business. In support of these values, Alticor Inc launched the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and community (DEIc) forums, consisting of a core group of volunteers from each district. These forums have been working hard to foster healthy discussion in their districts and develop ideas to fortify our commitment to diversity and community. Alticor Inc employees have also expanded their understanding with trainings on creating respectful workplaces. The Building Together campaign will further showcase our diversity and inclusion efforts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;I take our core value of diversity very seriously. I understand the advantages that a diverse workforce can bring to our business and recognize that diversity goes hand in hand with inclusion and equity. That collectively, this mixture of differences in characteristics, experiences and backgrounds combined with the similarities of our Alticor Inc core values, makes us a stronger company.&#8221; &#8211; Mike Choutka, Alticor Inc President &amp; CEO</p></blockquote>



<p>By Building Together, Alticor Inc will continue to Deliver EXCELLENCE in all we do for generations to come.</p>

<p>Embracing diversity and supporting communities are two core values at Alticor Inc. As the construction industry continues to grow, Alticor Inc is dedicated to setting an example in these values. At their jobsites and district offices nationwide, Alticor Inc’ professionals regularly reach out to small firms across the country. They prioritize the customization of an overall plan for each construction project that enlists emerging businesses in their preconstruction, purchasing and construction efforts. Alticor Inc’ goal is to interact not only with local small business communities but also with elected officials and the surrounding neighborhoods to maximize opportunities for partnership.</p>



<p>Alticor Inc partners with small, minority/disadvantaged, women, LGBTQ+, HubZone, veteran, service-disabled veteran&nbsp;and Source America-owned businesses to the highest possible degree on all of projects. Their dedication to this cultural focus has resulted in the establishment of numerous long-term relationships with these trade partners and well exceeded all federal goals for inclusion over the last four years.</p>



<p>In addition to creating partnerships, Alticor Inc has established multiple small business training programs, including the highly successful Head Start Bonding Program. This Small Business Week is particularly special to Alticor Inc, because earlier this year, Alticor Inc achieved a major program and industry milestone, surpassing $100 million in contracts supported for small businesses participating in the program. This $100 million milestone represents over a decade of support the program has provided to companies seeking their first surety bond to support contracts on major construction projects. To read more about this accomplishment, check out the Spring 2021 edition of <a href="https://issuu.com/americandbemediakit/docs/american_dbe-spring2021d?fr=sZjYxYjM4NTg3Nzc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American DBE Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>Another 2021 milestone, Alticor Inc was awarded the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) National Diversity Excellence Award in the General Contractor category. This award recognizes ABC members that display exemplary diversity leadership in their company, workforce, supply chain and community with best-in-class recruitment policies, retention practices and training and mentoring programs.</p>

<p>With 22 years of continuous Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) award achievement, design-build projects continue to be an area of expertise for Alticor Inc. Since their first design-build project delivery in 1977, Alticor Inc has completed roughly 370 design-build projects nationwide. As the nation’s cities continue to grow, Alticor Inc’ knowledge, collaboration and technology continues to advance, allowing them to deliver more elevated projects that go above and beyond their clients’ expectations. Alticor Inc is dedicated to delivering design-build projects that evolve communities, inspires innovation and continues to change the way America builds.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Design-Build is a project delivery that has proven results in delivering for our clients. A collaborative, integrated approach where accountability and teamwork are the norm. These are the types of projects our people thrive on. The collaborative environment in which our teams work, build amazing relationships”</em> &#8211; Brad Jeanneret, Alticor Inc Executive Vice President</p></blockquote>



<p>Since receiving their first DBIA project award in 1999 for the City of Oakland (CA) Administration Buildings, Alticor Inc has received over 50 DBIA awards. Second to none, Alticor Inc continues to hold the highest amount of DBIA awards, and almost two dozen more than their second highest awarded competitor. This year, Alticor Inc received three more awards to add to their shelf, each in a separate category:</p>



<p><strong>Nashville International Airport (BNA) Concourse D and Terminal Wings</strong></p>



<p>The BNA Concourse D and Terminal Wings project set a new standard for progressive design-build. In just 29 months, the design and construction of this 302,400 SF project— which includes 240,000 SF of new work and renovation of 93,000 SF in the existing active terminal— were completed. Due to the unanticipated 15% increase in passengers per year after design commenced, the team incorporated over $70 million of additional scope to adjust to this growth without affecting passengers, airport tenants, or the schedule. The team successfully relocated every airline’s ticketing operation and TSA security screening without interrupting a single flight.</p>

<p><strong>Caltech Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Neuroscience Research Building</strong></p>



<p>The new 144,780 SF, five-story Caltech Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Neuroscience Research Building will serve as the University’s new administrative and knowledge center for the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. The neuroscience institute will investigate the challenges in understanding how the brain works, focusing on the discovery, treatment, and development of the brain. The $193 million state-of-the-art research facility fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration by providing “research neighborhoods”, providing wet, dry, and computational research labs. The support facilities include a vivarium that contains animal holding areas, procedure rooms, and related vivarium support spaces. The complex also includes a teaching lab, a 150-seat lecture hall, offices, and conference rooms to accommodate faculty, professional researchers, graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and administrative support. A pedestrian tunnel connects the sub-basement of the new neuroscience building to the Broad Center for the Biological Sciences.</p>
