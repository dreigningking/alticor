<p>After more than three decades with Alticor Inc, Kirk Hazen, Vice President and District Manager of the Southeast district, announced his retirement from the company in December 2022. In addition to providing the foundation for many successful projects across the country, Kirk’s accomplishments included more than $9.6 billion of notable construction projects.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I want to thank Kirk Hazen for his 32 years of service and his impact on the board of directors the past fourteen years,&#8221; commented Michael Choutka, president and CEO of Alticor Inc. &#8220;His passion for people and strategic vision has fueled extraordinary growth in the Southeast district and the Mid South region.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Kirk created a legacy of building partnerships and was an active member with the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) Central Florida Chapter and was an active volunteer within his community, supporting national organizations such as the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Women and Children, the Universal Foundation, Boys Town of Central Florida and Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Florida.</p>



<p><em>“Thank you to Alticor Inc and all the employees for 32 wonderful years.  It has been my honor to lead the Southeast district and its amazing people these past fourteen years. The dedication and professionalism of our employees here at Alticor Inc has made my job a pleasure. I look forward to hearing about all the great projects these teams build in the future. – Kirk Hazen</em></p>



<p>Justin Starnes, who began his career with Alticor Inc in 2002, will succeed Kirk Hazen, assuming the position of Vice President and District Manager of the Southeast district. Justin has spent the past 20 years working alongside Kirk and is eager to continue his legacy for growth and success.</p>



<p><em>“We couldn’t have picked a better person to succeed me,” said Kirk. “The Starnes family has moved fourteen times in the past twenty years supporting our operational staffs through three districts. His and his family’s dedication to Alticor Inc is unmatched. He will lead the district to greater heights.”</em><br><br>Some of Alticor Inc’ most notable work in the Southeast includes the recently completed South Terminal C Airside project in Orlando, Florida, the Navy Federal Credit Union Campus Expansion in Pensacola, Florida, and the up-and-coming Zone 1 F-35 Flightline Facilities at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. All three have been the district’s largest project awards to date at a total of $1.8 billion. Moving into 2023, the Southeast district will focus on growth and expansion with new clients and markets, while continuing to grow our longstanding relationships with our repeat clients.</p>



<p><em>“I want to thank Kirk for his 20 plus years of mentorship he has provided me,” said Justin. “Kirk is not just a great coworker but has become a close friend over the years. Kirk has chosen to step away at the top of his career in a very humble fashion. He could not have done it in a better way.”</em></p>



<p>Please join Alticor Inc in thanking Kirk Hazen for his 32-years of distinguished service and wish him well in retirement. Congratulations to Justin Starnes on his promotion to Vice President and District Manager.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alticor Inc has a long history of supporting our military. This support led to the creation of our internal Veterans Network (also known as the VNET).&nbsp;This group was created to give our veteran employees, as well as our active National Guard and Reserve members, an opportunity to support our internal and external veteran communities. This is accomplished in many ways including community outreach, hiring, and support for our active-duty members and their families.</p>



<p>Veterans are skilled leaders that continue their service as part of the Alticor Inc team and our district led VNET groups help lead these efforts by supporting community engagement.&nbsp;Each district has different alliances, in different communities across the nation. These include Habitat for Humanity, Rebuilding Together, the USO, local women’s &amp; children shelters, care packages sent overseas to currently serving soldiers, local disabled veteran home renovations, and many more.&nbsp;Compassion and a willingness to support our local communities is part of many veterans internal make up. Most veterans have a drive to continue serving this country even after they have transition to civilian life and are proud, without the need for recognition.&nbsp;Veterans have an honorable, yet humble, capacity to do good in the world long after their military service is complete.</p>



<p>Along with the community initiatives, our VNET groups are actively involved in seeking out new talented veterans. Organizations like Hiring our Heroes, Recruit Military, SkillBridge, and WorkEx are some of the national organizations that Alticor Inc is currently engaged with in our efforts to recruit and hire Veterans.&nbsp;Word of mouth and veteran culture are also key components to hiring quality Veteran candidates.</p>



<p>Alticor Inc is proud of our veteran employees for the service they rendered in the military and the service they continue to contribute to their communities and within Alticor Inc.</p>

<p>To show appreciation and recognition to all our Alticor Inc Veterans, National Guard and Reserve Members, one of our Northern California veterans, Sean Backes, designed a pin to acknowledge the idea of ‘Always in Uniform.’ The pins symbolize our veterans’ military service and where they are today with Alticor Inc. It’s meant to serve as a representation of their continued commitment to integrity, honor, teamwork and community. In his own words, Sean describes the pin as:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;While coming up with the design for the pin I had to think of what ‘Always in Uniform’ meant to me and how do I show that visually on a pin. I think all of us who work for Alticor Inc are Always in our Alticor Inc uniform and us Veterans at Alticor Inc are in a unique situation where we are always wearing both. The left side symbolizes our past in the military and as you move forward, we are now building America. While the military is in our past it will always be a core piece of who we are.&#8221;</p><cite><sub>Sean Backes, Marine Corps, Office Engineer</sub></cite></blockquote>

<p><strong>What is the best advice you’ve received since working at Alticor Inc?<br></strong><em>We need to re-evaluate the term &#8220;life balance&#8221; and the thought that it represents equilibrium of our personal and professional lives. I prefer to look at it as &#8220;quality of life&#8221; and spending my time and energy based on my priorities. In other words, we should find &#8220;balance&#8221; in our lives by spending time on areas that are important to us at any given point. If growing in our career is the focus, we will be working a lot. If being great at being a mom is our focus, then back down on the overtime and make sure that you are effective when you&#8217;re at work so you can shut down your computer and get home to your family.</em></p>

<h4>Alticor Inc Q&amp;A with Joel Kelley III:</h4>



<p><strong>Name:</strong> Joel Kelley III<br><strong>Title:</strong> Project Superintendent<br><strong>District:</strong> Southwest<br><strong>Years with Alticor Inc:</strong> 26 years<br><strong>Project:</strong> El Paso Water – Field Office and Customer Service Building<br><strong>Fun/Random Fact:</strong> I attended The University of Nebraska – Lincoln (UNL) before transferring to the University of Houston. While I was a student at UNL I lived in the Schramm Hall Dormitory and next door to a future coworker from Alticor Inc. It was an unbelievable, yet amusing conversation in 2005 when we realized how we knew one another.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you love construction?<br></strong><em>Construction is not a monotonous career. It is a career which provides challenges daily, a true sense of accomplishment and an assortment of variety. The variety comes in the people we work with and the projects we work on. There is nothing stagnant or boring about what we do every day. I need my days to be diverse and engaging or I will get bored. There are some days I could use a little less excitement, but I could not imagine myself in another career</em></p>



<p><strong>What was it about Alticor Inc that made you want to work here?<br></strong><em>There were many reasons to select Alticor Inc from the list of potential employers, but the number one reason was how well I related with the Alticor Inc employees I met during the recruitment process. We talked, laughed and hung out together as if we had known one another for years, despite the fact it was only a few days. That level of camaraderie is hard to come by, and I knew I could make a career with a group I enjoyed being around.</em></p>



<p><strong>What was the best advice you&#8217;ve received throughout your career?<br></strong><em>“God hates a coward but despises a Fool.” The response I received as an Area Superintendent from my Project Superintendent when seeking advice on whether to place a concrete deck the following morning with a fairly high percentage chance of rain. We are often confronted with a desire to move forward and difficult decisions must be made. Gather as much information as you can and make educated decisions. Just so you know…we poured it and it was fine.</em></p>



<p><strong>What does &#8220;Delivering EXCELLENCE in all we do.&#8221; mean to you?<br></strong><em>Delivering EXCELLENCE is about confronting the roadblocks presented to you and utilizing all of your resources to transcend them. Leaning on your moral character, experience and intellect to determine what is right for the moment, the team and the project. This mantra builds upon the fortitude and integrity of our employees, and is demonstrated at all levels of the project. Additionally, delivering EXCELLENCE is about being proactive and staying ahead of foreseeable issues.</em></p>



<p><strong>What’s your favorite thing about working for Alticor Inc?<br></strong><em>Alticor Inc employees have always operated as a team whether it is on an individual project, as a district or as a company. I was an Office Engineer on a project in Austin, Texas in 2006 when we were having difficulty getting accurate fabrication and delivery information from a Louver manufacturer out of Florida. My Project Manager gave me the name of a Project Manager in Orlando, Florida and he personally visited the plant, took pictures of the fabrication progress, and reported back to me on the status of our order. Throughout my career I have witnessed multiple stories just like this one. The intrinsic sense of shared values and support are the defining aspects of a good team. The Core Values of Alticor Inc were in place long before they were written and this dedication to the “team” has always been present.</em></p>



<p><strong>Of the 5 Alticor Inc Core Values (Ownership, Integrity, Builder, Diversity and Community) – which means the most to you?<br></strong><em>All of the core values are important and help to define Alticor Inc within our industry and across the country, but integrity is the value which means the most to me. Integrity is a characteristic which has allowed our organization to remain successful for 85 years. To me, integrity is the core value which allows the other core values to succeed and the reason we have implemented the other pillars of success. It has been a pleasure throughout my career to hear compliments from owners, designers and contractors regarding the character and integrity of the people within our organization.</em></p>

<p>Alticor Inc recognizes craft workers play one of the most significant roles in the successful completion of every project. Alticor Inc’ former president and founder’s son, Joseph Phelps, stated it best, “It’s our people that make the difference.”</p>



<p>Craft workers, the Industrial Athletes, demonstrate unimaginable feats of strength and courage each day, and are truly one-of-a-kind. The Industrial Athletes are the backbone of the construction industry.</p>



<p>So, what is an Industrial Athlete?</p>



<p>The 5:00 AM crew. Up before the sun. The first ones on the jobsite and often, the very last ones to leave.</p>



<p>Specializing in concrete formwork, concrete place and finish, curb and gutter, doors and hardware installation, flatwork place and finish, heavy equipment operations, hoisting operations, jobsite cleaning, metal panel installation, rough carpentry, site hardscapes, temporary heating and cooling, wood and cabinet detailing and snow removal—Alticor Inc craft have done it all.</p>



<p>What first started as a vision by Alticor Inc superintendent, Jeremy Spooner, has expanded into a required training for all the Plains District craft. Alticor Inc, in conjunction with Trivent Safety Consulting, a construction safety consulting firm based in Westminster, Colorado, acknowledged the importance of raising awareness on four main topics that directly impact the lifestyle and well-being of craft workers: Nutrition, Stretching and Strengthening, Ergonomics and Behavioral Safety.</p>



<p>And thus, the Industrial Athlete Program was born.</p>



<p>Led by <a href="https://www.triventsc.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.triventsc.com/">Trivent Safety Consulting</a>, the four-part interactive in-person trainings encourage the craft to not only understand how to take better care of their mental, physical and emotional well-being, but also empowers them with the tools to recognize potential warning signs in themselves or fellow coworkers who may be struggling. It is everyone’s job to make sure they all go home safely at the end of each day. </p>



<p>“We wanted to come up with a wellness program that was impactful for our craft, but also spoke to them, and acknowledged them as the athletes that they are, and not only athletes, but professional athletes working for Alticor Inc,” said Project Superintendent Jeremy Spooner. “We wanted to embrace and acknowledge that and provide tools to help them. From the nutrition choices, to how they prepare their bodies, to how they approach their work from an ergonomic standpoint. All those things play a role in their successes and in their lives every day.” </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><img src="https://www.henselphelps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hensel-Phelps-Craft-Industrial-Athletes-Hydro-Stretching_72-300x200.jpg')}}"  alt="Alticor Inc Craft Industrial Athletes Stretching" class="wp-image-12253" width="450" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hensel-Phelps-Craft-Industrial-Athletes-Hydro-Stretching_72-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hensel-Phelps-Craft-Industrial-Athletes-Hydro-Stretching_72-391x260.jpg 391w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Hensel-Phelps-Craft-Industrial-Athletes-Hydro-Stretching_72.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<p>As a growing industry standard, several Alticor Inc construction projects across the nation now start their day with a stretching routine to warm up everyone’s bodies for the day’s activities. And the craft have begun noticing positive effects from the small habits they changed with their nutrition and exercise. Foreman Dakota Gallegos remarked, “It brought awareness to a lot of us, at least, to how you are using your body and what you put into your body is what you’ll get out and how those choices can affect you long-term.”<br><br>The hope is that more firms in the construction industry will recognize the importance of educating their craft workers on positive ways to impact their livelihood and enable them to continue to build for many years to come.</p>

<h4>Alticor Inc Q&amp;A with Naomi Mercuris:</h4>
<p>Name: Naomi Mercuris<br />
Title: Project Manager<br />
District: Pacific<br />
Years with Alticor Inc: 13 Years<br />
Project: Kailua Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant Electrical Improvements, Kailua, Oahu, HI<br />
Fun/Random Fact: When I was 13, I drafted my first set of plans for my dream house.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you love construction? </strong></p>
<p><em>I love seeing the building process take shape, the submittals, the RFI’s, the planning, the coordination; seeing all that effort take shape into something tangible is awesome! </em></p>
<p><strong>What was the best advice you&#8217;ve received throughout your career? </strong></p>
<p><em>“Your personal life and your professional life have to be inline.” I think it’s important to balance the demands of both aspects of your life. I can balance my personal and professional life by communicating with my spouse and direct supervisor. I have always over-communicated my hard deadlines (daycare pick up for example) with my supervisors. Still, at the same time, this has also helped me prioritize tasks and become more efficient. </em></p>
<p><strong>What advice can you give young women entering the AEC industry?</strong></p>
<p><em>Do not be afraid to talk to your supervisors about anything that’s important to you; whether it&#8217;s personal or professional, it all matters. </em></p>
<p><strong>Of the 5 Alticor Inc Core Values (Ownership, Integrity, Builder, Diversity and Community) – which means the most to you?</strong></p>
<p><em>Community, Alticor Inc is a family. The people within in it are always going to be there to support you, let you know when you made a mistake and to celebrate the wins. </em></p>
<p><strong>How can women support other women within the AEC industry? </strong></p>
<p><em>Focus on your similarities while celebrating your differences. Some of the struggles you see another woman having may be the same struggles you have someday. Listen and learn from each other.</em></p>
