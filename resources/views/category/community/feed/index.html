<p>American Abatement &amp; Demo (AAD) CEO and President Mari Borrero has worked hard to build AAD and create her reputation as a construction executive from the ground up. AAD is a local, state-certified disadvantaged, minority/women and veteran-owned small business based in Auburn, Washington that performs abatement, demolition and cleanup services.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:28% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="731" height="1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1-731x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15673 size-full" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1-731x1024.jpg 731w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1-214x300.jpg 214w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mari-Headshot-1.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Mari developed the idea of AAD because her husband was already performing those services for his employer but wanted to see things done differently. Knowing she could run the business side of AAD, Mari and her husband combined their skill sets and launched the company.</p>



<p>“I had to change my mindset to what if it does work, what if I do get it right, what if the right people come into my life,” said Mari.</p>



<p>Her hard work and determination continue to pay off, as Mari received the William D. Bradford Minority Business of the Year Award at the 2022 University of Washington Impact Awards. Her inspiring story takes us through the twists and turns of her transition from being a schoolteacher to taking a chance on herself and becoming an award-winning businesswoman.</p>
</div></div>



<h4 id="h-building-american-abatement-demo-through-mentorship-and-community">Building American Abatement &amp; Demo Through Mentorship and Community</h4>



<p>In June of 2017, she decided to leave her teaching position to work on building American Abatement &amp; Demo (AAD) full-time.</p>



<p>“I didn’t know construction five years ago. I took every course offered to me, invested in myself, reached out to people and built a system around me,” said Mari.</p>



<p>She went beyond just going to class to get certifications and surrounded herself with strong mentors that she could learn from, creating a support system around her.</p>



<p>“Research says that in order for kids to read, they need five caring adults in their lives that read to them, and I don’t think that’s any different when you’re an adult. You need to have those five different people in your life who invest in you and are your mentors.”</p>



<p>Alticor Inc and Mari first met at a National Association of Minority Contractors (NAMC) Washington event in 2018. Mari was encouraged to bid on Alticor Inc’ Seattle Public Schools Queen Anne Elementary School Addition where she successfully received a $50,000 contract for demolition.</p>



<p>This was AAD’s first contract with a large general contractor and their first major commercial project. The Alticor Inc project team and Mari worked together to compile submittals, safety plans and cash flow projections. The team had a series of site walks and planning discussions that enabled AAD to successfully complete its first large project and first Seattle Public Schools project.</p>

<p>Mari describes Alticor Inc as being intentional and involved in their mentorship. This helped them to build trust with one another, furthering their relationship and partnering potential.</p>



<p>“Alticor Inc has never made me feel like I can’t ask for help, it has always been a safe and trusting relationship,” said Mari.</p>



<p>When presented with a challenge as she started her business, Mari looked to her mentors and support system around her for guidance. She knew she had to take the proper steps to legitimize AAD and take it to the next level. Alticor Inc&#8217; Vice President and District Manager Shannon Gustine and Operations Manager Dave Hutt have served as mentors to Mari, helping her to navigate the challenges of a growing business.</p>



<p>“I really needed to make sure that I ran a business that’s legit. There are standards and procedures I originally didn’t realize were there since we were just a mom-and-pop shop,” said Mari. “If you want to play in the game, you’ve got to know the rules.”</p>

<p>The Head Start Program is an exclusive program brokered through The Barbour Group that supports subcontractors who need financial assistance, are first time bond users or need more bonding capacity. The goals of the program include increasing participation of qualified small businesses on Alticor Inc projects and helping small businesses reach their long-term goals. In October of 2020, Mari met with Alticor Inc to utilize the Head Start Program’s services and has since increased AAD’s bonding capacity to over $1 million.</p>



<p>Her mentorship with Dave Hutt has helped her to navigate past roadblocks and take more tasks into her own hands, helping to put things back on her schedule.</p>



<p>Hutt also provided Mari with advice and assistance when a waste management company could not take debris containers when she needed them to, resulting in a delay of schedule. Instead of waiting for the waste management companies and with help from Hutt, she was able to get her own cans and is now able to handle waste removal on her own.</p>



<p>“[Alticor Inc] is able to bring a lens of different solutions that I am not aware of because I haven’t been in this industry forever.”</p>

<h4 id="h-developing-herself-while-growing-a-business">Developing Herself While Growing a Business</h4>



<p>In late 2018, Alticor Inc had the opportunity to support a business’ participation in the University of Washington (UW) Foster School of Business &#8211; Ascend Business Growth Program, which provides business owners with the ability to learn proven business practices. Alticor Inc immediately thought of Mari, and she took full advantage of the opportunity.</p>



<p>She not only graduated from the program but also received a full scholarship to the UW Minority Business Executive Program. In addition, Mari was selected for the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative. She completed both programs with excellence and has applied what she learned to her business.</p>



<p>Mari not only expanded her knowledge of the services the program offered but quickly experienced rapid growth as a business owner and a leader.</p>



<p>“Something that I learned was as time goes by you have to trust that the people you are putting in place can do their jobs without you micromanaging them.”</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<h4>Serving Her Community Beyond the Scope of Work</h4>



<p>Mari has a mindset that she can make a difference and an impact on her community beyond the physical work performed by AAD. She’s more than just an employer to those who work for her, but a mentor who looks for ways to help develop their careers and guide them throughout their time with AAD.</p>



<p>When she first started AAD, Mari had a focus on providing jobs to people who had previously been incarcerated. She recognized the challenges they experience and wanted to help them get back on their feet.</p>



<p>“I built a business oriented in helping those that were previously incarcerated by helping them find a job they can feed their families with.”</p>



<p>In more recent years, she has created a partnership with Boys and Girls Club to provide older members with internships so that she can mentor and introduce them to construction. If the internship goes well, she can then offer them a full-time job and help them kickstart their career.</p>



<p>Mari is deeply connected to the larger scale impact she has had on people’s lives. She became emotional as she reflected on one of her current employees who joined her from the Boys and Girls Club partnership. She comments that while it has not only has it been amazing to see his growth at work and the various milestones he has reached, she knows the stable job is going a long way for his family as well.</p>



<p>“To scale it back a little bit more, he’s got two little boys at home. What are you doing for those kids’ dad when he gets home? It makes me cry, because that is what it’s all about,” said Mari. “When Alticor Inc gives us contracts it goes way beyond just the contract.”</p>



<p>Making an impact in others&#8217; lives is what Mari is most passionate about, and she uses the resources and opportunities she now has to give back and help others.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:45% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15689 size-full" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/AAD-Truck-Employees-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>“How I have made people feel while they’re here and taking the time to help people get to their next best self is what will last after I’m gone. They’ll be talking about me, it’s my legacy.”</p>



<p>With each new job, Mari is able to provide her employees with the opportunity to take their career to the next level and further her mission of helping others.</p>



<p>“If people really knew the depth of the help that Alticor Inc provides and who it helps beyond the office walls in Bellevue, you&#8217;d understand how impactful it has been and how it&#8217;s changing people&#8217;s lives outside of this office,” said Mari.</p>
</div></div>



<h4>Looking to the Future</h4>



<p>Following her successful work on the Queen Anne Elementary School Addition project, Mari went on to perform demolition and abatement on Alticor Inc’ Tukwila School District Renovation and the GSA Pacific Highway Land Port of Entry Envelopment Replacement (LPOE) project. LPOE was her first federal contract, and Alticor Inc helped her navigate the stringent project requirements while working on an active border crossing. It was her first contract to span multiple months and taught her how to manage her cash flow in order to float the project for three months. This project paved the way for Mari to join the 8(a) Business Development Program through the U.S. Small Business Administration, broadening her opportunities nationwide.</p>



<p>Moving forward, Mari is looking to expand AAD to Texas so that she can be closer to her family. Once there, she hopes to scale up her program with McKinstry and will take a class with Goldman Sachs to help work out the details of her Texas expansion. She will continue her partnership with Alticor Inc both in Seattle and Texas.</p>

<p>Each year, the Alticor Inc Pacific Northwest Region hosts an annual Veterans Day Event to raise funds and awareness for organizations focused on the health and well-being of our nation&#8217;s veterans. This year, the Pacific Northwest Region facilitated its 4th Annual Veterans Day Event with a fundraising drive and raffle to raise money for <a href="https://ptsdfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Permission to Start Dreaming</a>. Permission to Start Dreaming is a non-profit organization dedicated to offering alternative therapies to help soldiers, first responders and their families readjust to life back home. </p>



<p>Veteran-owned BoneFrog Coffee also came back for their second Veterans Day Event with our team. BoneFrog Coffee, founded by retired Navy SEAL Tim Cruickshank, provided wine, signature coffee blends and stories of the journey and sacrifice of serving in our nation&#8217;s armed forces. </p>



<p>Through employee and trade partner contributions, the Pacific Northwest Region raised more than $22,000 for Permission to Start Dreaming to further their mission of finding answers and programs for the long journey of healing from the invisible wounds of war and service-related injuries. The Permission to Start Dreaming team plans to use the funds raised to purchase property to host therapeutic retreats for local veterans and first responders focused on stress recovery. </p>



<h4 id="h-about-permission-to-start-dreaming"><strong>About Permission to Start Dreaming</strong></h4>



<p>Permission to Start Dreaming founder Leslie Mayne lost her veteran son to suicide in 2009. Leslie took her unimaginable tragedy and turned it into inspiration by founding the Permission to Start Dreaming (PTSD) Foundation in Gig Harbor, Washington. The Foundation hosts events and programs that support Post Traumatic Growth—the idea that veterans and first responders can become stronger post-trauma after they correctly process it. </p>

<p>In the US, there are currently over 863,830 women living with cancer. One out of every three of these individuals will battle breast cancer. In fact, of the total population of women residing in the US, 12.9% will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. It is this statistic that compels Alticor Inc to talk about the subject, and to do our part to support a cause that impacts so many of our employees.</p>



<p>As the number of women wearing a Alticor Inc hardhat has grown over the years, so has the realization of just how devastating this disease can be. We want our employees to know that we are there for them, to support them through their cancer journey. We also recognize the hardship our employees go through when experiencing cancer indirectly, standing by the side of a wife, a mother, a daughter, a soul mate—any loved one suffering through the unimaginable.</p>



<p>In effort to truly understand what our employees and their loved ones go through during this difficult time, Alticor Inc sat down with a few of our own to hear what they have to say and to provide information and inspiration to others going through their own personal cancer journey:</p>

Lawson, Ph.D., Associate Professor at UCI’s Chao Family Comprehensive&nbsp;Cancer Center</sub></cite></blockquote>



<p>In support of Alticor Inc’ effort to promote Women’s Health Awareness, Alticor Inc has partnered with both University of California Irvine’s Cancer Research Center as well as Team Michelle, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to funding research and providing support to survivors and their families. This fall, Alticor Inc will participate in UCI’s Anti-Cancer Challenge, a community movement to raise awareness and funds for critical cancer research, as well donate proceeds from their annual golf tournament to UCI, with the mission to fund cancer research. This upcoming spring, Alticor Inc will partake in Team Michelle’s Annual 10-Mile Walk, aiding Team Michelle’s mission to support essential programs and fund two specific research projects, as well as fund Team Michelle’s Acts of Love program, which aids breast cancer patients financially during their journey to recovery.</p>



<p>Alticor Inc employees and their family members are encouraged to take part in Team Michelle’s company-wide walk on April 22, 2023, and can register for the walk <a href="https://secure.qgiv.com/event/10milewalk/register/form/registration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Upon sign-up, make sure to select &#8220;Team Alticor Inc&#8221; to participate alongside teammates and friends.</p>



<p>In addition to Team Michelle’s Annual Walk, Alticor Inc encourages employees and their loved ones to take advantage of some of the other offerings Team Michelle provides to its community of survivors:</p>



<p><strong>Acts of Love</strong></p>

<p><strong>About the UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge</strong></p>



<p>The UCI Anti-Cancer Challenge is a community ride/run/walk to raise funds for cancer research at the UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. One hundred percent of the money raised by participants goes directly to early phase studies and clinical trials. These funds are a powerful source of flexible support. In 2019, more than 2,800 participants contributed $635,000 to cancer center research.</p>



<p>Over the life of the event, proceeds have enabled progress on more than three dozen research projects, each one expanding our understanding of cancer in its many forms. When you stop at nothing to make a difference, this is where the end of cancer begins. To learn more, visit anti-cancerchallenge.org.</p>

<p>Over the course of Building Together, Alticor Inc has focused and raised awareness on many significant topics, both from an employer and industry standpoint, the importance of each matter, and how each topic impacts fellow co-workers, trade partners, family members and the future of Alticor Inc. During the month of October, Alticor Inc will put emphasis on an equally important topic, one that impacts over 700 of its employees, women’s health. An advocate of mental health, and a supporter of initiatives like the Culture of Care program, Alticor Inc wanted to take a moment to address a topic of equal importance—physical health.</p>



<p>As one of the more physically demanding fields, construction can take a toll on the body. But sometimes these physical feats go beyond what’s present on the jobsite. From pregnancy to cancer, the women that make our projects possible battle through extraordinary physical feats, many times with a can-do attitude and smile. We want to make sure that we take the time to recognize these situations and do our best to understand what our fellow employees, partners and loved ones might be experiencing both physically and mentally outside of the hardhat.</p>



<p>To help Alticor Inc build awareness surrounding some of these important health topics, we will hear directly from employees, clients, and professional experts, about their first-hand experience on these critical health topics:</p>



<p><strong>Pregnancy and Motherhood</strong> – Nearly 1/3 of all women in the labor force are mothers. As a major advocate for family, Alticor Inc supports working moms and encourages new moms and moms-to-be to focus on their well-being and time spent with new family members. This month, we’ll hear from the moms of Alticor Inc and what it was like to be pregnant on a working project, as well as tips (and lessons learned!) for those looking to grow their family.</p>



<p><strong>Disparity in Healthcare</strong> – Even though women make up over 50% of the US population, women are often underrepresented in health research and underserved in medical care. Throughout October, Alticor Inc will be offering employees internal resources to make sure they have the access they need to take care of themselves and their families, mentally and physically.</p>



<p><strong>Violence and Domestic Abuse</strong> – Globally, an estimated 736 million women, almost one in three, have been the victim of some form of violence. Alticor Inc does not condone violence in any shape or form. If someone you know is currently suffering from an abusive situation, please visit <a href="https://www.thehotline.org/">https://www.thehotline.org/</a> or call 800-799-7233.</p>



<p><strong>Breast and Gynecological Cancers</strong> – In the US, there are currently over 863,830 women living with cancer—that is 415 cases for every 100,000 individuals. One out of every three of those individuals will battle breast cancer. In fact, of the total population of women residing in the US, 12.9% will develop breast cancer within their lifetime. It is this statistic that compels Alticor Inc to talk about the subject, and to do our part to support a cause that impacts so many of our employees. Running parallel with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, this October, Alticor Inc will share stories, from team members and employees, about their personal cancer journeys. Alticor Inc will also be supporting <a href="https://teammichelle.org/">Team Michelle</a>, an organization near and dear to Alticor Inc, whose mission ensures that no women has to battle cancer alone.</p>



<p>Stay tuned all October to hear more on these important topics, hear inspirational stories from employees and partners and to help Alticor Inc create awareness surrounding Women’s Health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ruth Davila, President of Celsue Construction Services, Inc., was working as a Professional Engineer (PE) in 2004 when an opportunity presented itself – a chance to buy out Celsue Construction, a certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) specializing in Division 32 Concrete. The new role wasn’t an easy one, yet she managed to parent three young children and grow Celsue Construction into a successful business at the same time. Eventually, each of her children tried their hand at the family business and Ruth’s twin daughters, Lorena and Mariana, ultimately made the decision to stay.</p>



<p>The office is currently operated and managed by four uniquely passionate Latin women: Ruth, the President of Celsue Construction; daughter Lorena, who focuses on business development; daughter Mariana, who manages the company’s finances; and Celsue Construction’s newest member, Patricia, Celsue’s Office Manager and helps oversee operations. While building a family-owned and operated small business was an opportunity that Ruth was eager to pursue, it also came with its own set of challenges.</p>



<p>At first, Ruth, Lorena and Mariana did not often meet eye-to-eye when it came between work and family. Now, they must navigate separating the two; their “work family” from their “home family.” What are the dynamics of working with your family day in and day out? Does it change what it means to be a family at “home”? What are the challenges, as well as the benefits? David Fisher, Manager of Supplier Diversity, sat down with them to find out.</p>



<p><strong>David: What made you decide to transition from the engineering field to a small business owner in the Concrete Division 3 area?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ruth: </strong><em>I was working with a company where it was difficult to be an engineer as a Latino woman. I had never had this experience before in the industry; I had been welcomed everywhere. But at this company, I was not happy in the environment. I decided that I could do better, I could do something else. My husband, who is also a PE and invests in the real estate business, had a connection with Celsue Construction and found out they were selling the business. The opportunity was presented to me to buy the company, and I thought “Why not?” I didn’t have the money to buy the business, but they offered that I could pay them $50,000 every six months. So, I quit my job and went to work for them for free – they didn’t pay me anything for three months – just to learn the trade.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: What did the transition look like from being a licensed PE to a business owner in the construction industry?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> <em>I realized that, while I was an engineer, the construction side was a completely other game. Celsue started with curb and gutter, and I realized I had no idea how to build curb and gutter. So, I started going out with the crews to learn the process. I would have to leave home around 5:00 in the morning to join the crew to really see everything they did. I spent all my time watching those guys. They helped me a lot, not only with learning what they do, but I also learned production because I could see how long it took them to form, finish the concrete, remove the forms and so on.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: What was it like to move from a PE career and being safe in corporate America to being a business owner and responsible for employee payroll?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> <em>Oh, it was tough. The first three-five years were tough. I thought “What am I doing? Maybe I should go back to being employed by someone else.” There was a point when I had over $200,000 in credit card debt with an interest of over 20%. But what else was I going to do when I got a concrete invoice for $30,000 per week? If I didn’t pay, they would stop delivering. I don’t have any relatives here; I didn’t have anybody I could borrow money from – I was all on my own. I had no choice but to live on credit cards for three years. That was very painful, but I managed.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: What skillset(s) have you acquired or developed that you feel are essential to being a successful business owner in the construction industry?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lorena:</strong> <em>My mom is one of the most resilient, strongest people I’ve ever met. It’s not that she necessarily learned skills; she taught people around her in the transition. When I was younger, I saw emails, heard her on the phone and had been to the jobsites where I saw the way men disrespected her. It was disheartening; I would go home and I would think about it for the rest of the day. But my mom never took it from anybody. They would fight with her over a situation and would think that they were right and tell my mom she didn’t know anything. A few days later they would call my mom, apologize, and tell her she was right about the situation all along.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: How did having a family impact your decision to move into this career, especially with longer hours?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> <em>My girls were only 11 when I became president of Celsue. My working hours were very long and that was really hard for me. Because I am a mama and, even though I was an engineer, I wanted to be there for my children. Originally, I said I don’t mind if I don’t grow into a president of a corporation – I wanted to make cookies at home with my kids as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Lorena:</strong> <em>It was rough. I remember phases throughout our life when our mom was so dedicated to growing the business that we wouldn’t see her for a while. My dad’s the same way. All this happening, the business itself, the working hours, the personality, her leadership style, my leadership style, that all shaped the experiences I’ve gone through in life.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: When you saw your mother putting in those long hours, did you ever see yourself following in the same footsteps or going into the same industry?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Lorena:</strong> <em>Watching my mother grow her business when I was a young child made me realize I love business. I knew from a young age that I was going to one day own my own business. I was the kid in middle school buying candy at Costco and then marking those up to sell to kids in the hallway. My parents also gave me an engineering mindset – you break it apart and figure out how to put it back together. So, when I went to college, I already knew I wanted to go to the business school at the University of Maryland. After that, I went back to school to get my Associates Degree in construction management because I knew I belonged somewhere in construction. I didn’t know where yet, but I knew that the foundation grew from my mother. Our parents sat us down a lot and said “You’re either going to work for someone else for the rest of your life and make them richer every single day or you can go your own way and make your own path and be whomever you want to be. When you do something, you love, the money follows.</em></p>



<p><strong>Mariana:</strong> <em>I fell into the industry. I had a leave of absence from high school my junior year and I had nothing to do, so my dad would just take me to Celsue, and I would do minimal tasks for my mom. I started working there when I was 15 or 16 and I worked there throughout college. I didn’t go to school for business. I studied cultural anthropology; I did anthropology trips in India, and I’ve always just been interested in that. But I get satisfaction working for my mom.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: What are the dynamics of working with family? Challenges? Benefits?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mariana:</strong> <em>We had to set boundaries. After 5:00 PM, we told our parents that they couldn’t bring up anything work-related unless it was urgent and was something that had to be done tomorrow. But we had to make it very clear that we do not talk about work after work. Otherwise, work ends up being 24/7 and you associate your parents with work, and you want to avoid them! I have to keep my work mom separate from my home mom; it ends up being two different relationships.</em></p>



<p><strong>Lorena:</strong> <em>Before we set those boundaries, it was working at breakfast; working while grabbing my coffee; working at lunch; working on a three-hour car ride to the beach. Work mom and home mom were interchangeable; it was the same 24/7. But the beautiful thing about being a family and working together is we understand each other’s weaknesses and strengths. We all try to accommodate each other so that we can be the best version of ourselves. There are times when I have a breakdown at work and I’m super stressed. My mom might be super busy dealing with a bunch of bids, but she’ll stop what she’s doing, and we’ll sit down and have a mom-to-daughter pep talk. Who does that anywhere else? A lot of people spend so much time at work and they have such little family time because they have such little social life. But I get to have a social life and be with my family and work at the same time.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: What is the future for Celsue Construction?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ruth:</strong> <em>Well, their father is pushing them to follow the family business, but I always tell the girls they need to spend the rest of their lives doing something they like. If they don’t like it at Celsue, don’t work here. My son came to work for me when he graduated from university, and he couldn’t take it. He was there for three months and said “Mom, I don’t know how you love this. I hate it.” And I told him to hit the road.</em></p>



<p><strong>Lorena:</strong> <em>We definitely want to take over, but I want to combine my own dream into it. I want to open another department that focuses on flipping residential properties and investing in commercial buildings. Mariana and I want to have a subsidiary that focuses on the residential investment side, but we’re not there yet. We have a lot to learn.</em></p>



<p><strong>David: If Celsue were to create a Back to the Future movie about your company and experience, what information would the 2022 version of yourself share with the 2004 version of yourself?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mariana:</strong> <em>I’d say it gets better. In the beginning, we felt so lost. There were so many times we thought we would shut down.</em><strong>Lorena:</strong><em>I also didn’t realize how important consistency and perseverance are. I would tell our younger selves that that’s all you really need and everything else will follow. When you’re consistent and persevere, nothing is going to get in your way and even if it does, get up and keep going.</em><em>I would also tell the younger version of ourselves that if there’s a decision you have to make, choose the decision that makes you more uncomfortable. Because when you stay in your comfort zone, you don’t really grow. If it doesn’t challenge, you it doesn’t change you.</em></p>

<p>For decades, Alticor Inc has supported and celebrated small business trade partners. This month, in continuation of the Building Together campaign, Alticor Inc turns the spotlight to these trade partners to celebrate and empower our small business community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Partnering with small businesses is just good business practice to keep creating lasting partnerships and developing our industry,” says Brian Fish, Alticor Inc General Superintendent. “Small businesses can help us just as much as we can them with continuing to develop our people and foster their abilities to work through challenges.”</p>



<p>For many years, the construction industry has faced labor shortages. However, 2022 has seen unprecedented growth in the industry brought on by an influx in public spending through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. These combined changes have increased the demand for numerous types of projects after a global pandemic slowed construction in certain industries. Further, the “great reshuffle” has led to mass resignations in search of jobs that better fit employee needs and wants, making the labor market even more unpredictable.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“One challenge small businesses are currently facing is costs, not only for materials but also the rising costs of personnel. Demand for qualified people is making it hard to retain and pay the individuals&#8217; salaries that are in their budgets.”</p><cite><sub>Dwane Evans, Alticor Inc General Superintendent</sub></cite></blockquote>



<p>As a leader in the AEC industry, Alticor Inc has felt the impacts of these labor shortages and supply chain delays and has established programs that focus on employee retention. However, many contractors identify as small businesses and do not always have similar resources to mitigate the impacts felt by these recent trends. “The bigger contractors have the same problems;” Evans comments, “however, they have more power to get what they need before a small contractor could.”</p>



<p>Therefore, this September, Alticor Inc is providing programming, stories and resources that support the small business trade partner community in addressing these challenges. “Alticor Inc depends on our small business partners to help procure new projects by working together to find the most economical solutions. Large businesses can empower small businesses by providing them opportunities that meet their skill sets and, as they succeed, provide them additional opportunities that allow for their growth,” Alticor Inc Chief Estimator Justice Henecke says.</p>



<p>Throughout the month, we will be sharing small business stories, including an in-depth look at a family behind a small business and a conversation on the value of employee engagement with Mike Sarraille, a retired Navy Seal, author, podcast host, entrepreneur and CEO. Join Alticor Inc in supporting and empowering the small businesses and trade partners that contribute to the success of the AEC industry, our firm and communities across the country.</p>
