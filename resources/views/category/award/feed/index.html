<p>With over 20 years of Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) award achievement, design-build projects continue to be an area of expertise for Alticor Inc. Since their first design-build project delivery in 1977, Alticor Inc has completed over 400 design-build projects nationwide. As the nation’s cities continue to grow, Alticor Inc’ knowledge, collaboration and technology continues to advance, allowing them to deliver more elevated projects that go above and beyond their clients’ expectations. Alticor Inc is dedicated to delivering design-build projects that evolve communities, inspire innovation and continue to change the way America builds.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Today, the design-build project delivery methodology represents over 45% of all projects constructed in the U.S., thus it is no longer an alternative delivery method. Design-build, when done right, is a very power option in an owners’ tool box of available options for project delivery. The teamwork, trust and collaboration inherent in design-build creates an exceptional environment to help achieve exceptional project outcomes. Alticor Inc is extremely proud of our long successful track record of highly successful design-build projects and for being recognized as an industry leader in Design-Build.”</em> </p><cite><sub>&#8211; Steve M. Grauer, DBIA Chairman, Alticor Inc Vice President</sub></cite></blockquote>



<p>Since receiving its first DBIA project award in 1999, Alticor Inc has received over 55 DBIA awards. The firm continues to hold the highest amount of DBIA awards, and almost two dozen more than their second highest awarded competitor. This year, Alticor Inc received seven DBIA awards:</p>



<p><strong>Department of General Services California Air Resources Board –&nbsp;Mary D. Nichols Campus</strong></p>



<p>The Mary D. Nichols Campus project consolidated California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) seven existing locations spread throughout Los Angeles into a single 19-acre location in Riverside, CA. The $411 million state-of-the-art facility includes an extended range of dedicated test cells for testing of heavy and light duty vehicles, an advanced chemistry laboratory and workspace for accommodating new test methods for future generations of vehicles throughout its 408,175 SF. The project also includes space for developing enhanced onboard diagnostics and portable emissions measurement systems, visitor reception and education areas, a media center, flexible conference areas and a large public auditorium.</p>

<p><strong>Sound Transit Operations and Maintenance Facility East</strong></p>



<p>Sound Transit (ST) sought to double its Light Rail Vehicles (LRV) fleet to support the East Link expansion of the light rail network to connect downtown Seattle to communities on the east side of Lake Washington. The project required a joint land-use entitlement for the maintenance facility and a surplus property development / Master Development Plan design that preserved 6.9 acres of the 28-acre site for a Transit Oriented Development, which includes affordable housing, and market-rate housing, and commercial spaces. This project was launched to support the needs of the growing community, and the resulting design-build, LEED Gold certified Operations and Maintenance Facility East (OMF East) project in Bellevue, WA will store, maintain, and deploy a 96 light rail vehicle fleet to support the Sound Transit (ST) expansion.</p>

<p>Associated Builders and Contractors’ Excellence in Construction awards program is the industry’s leading competition that honors both general and specialty contractors for innovative and high-quality merit shop construction projects. The award honors all construction team members, including the contractor, owner, architect and engineer. All projects were judged on complexity, attractiveness, unique challenges, completion time, workmanship, innovation, safety and cost.</p>



<p><strong>The Orlando International Airport (MCO) South Terminal C Airside project accepted the 2022 Excellence in Construction Project of the Year Award and an Eagle Award in the Infrastructure Over $250 Million category.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="665" src="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-MCO-Terminal-C-Finals-5.jpg')}}"  alt="" class="wp-image-15370" srcset="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-MCO-Terminal-C-Finals-5.jpg 1000w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-MCO-Terminal-C-Finals-5-300x200.jpg 300w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-MCO-Terminal-C-Finals-5-768x511.jpg 768w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/HP-MCO-Terminal-C-Finals-5-391x260.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Alticor Inc provided construction manager-at-risk services on the new 19-gate world-class airside terminal serving both international and domestic flights. The three-level, 732,895 SF terminal will accommodate travel for over 10 million additional passengers and connect to the existing intermodal terminal facility. As the first LEEDv4 airport campus in the world, passengers are drawn from one element to the next in a more spacious and convenient environment that delivers on customer care throughout.</p>



<p><strong>The Vulcan Centaur Infrastructure Activation project received the 2022 Excellence in Construction Eagle Award in the Industrial $100-250 Million category.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="665" src="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Vulcan-Activations-Pad-Aerial-3.jpg')}}"  alt="" class="wp-image-15371" srcset="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Vulcan-Activations-Pad-Aerial-3.jpg 1000w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Vulcan-Activations-Pad-Aerial-3-300x200.jpg 300w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Vulcan-Activations-Pad-Aerial-3-768x511.jpg 768w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Vulcan-Activations-Pad-Aerial-3-391x260.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Alticor Inc provided modifications to Launch Complex-41 and other definable scopes of work to support the new Vulcan Centaur vehicle. Work was completed throughout five locations within the United Launch Alliance facilities: the launch pad, vehicle integration facility, spaceflight processing operations center, the Vulcan launch platform, and service vans. The $190 million, 160,000 SF project constructed over four years is the same complex modified in 1998 by Alticor Inc. With an average launch cost of $225 million, safety measures were not only important to protect construction personnel, but also ensure quality to guarantee a safe and successful launch. From day one, ULA, Alticor Inc and the U.S. Air Force Partners were one integrated team with one goal: project success. The collaborative atmosphere is a perfect example of how effective communication can result in mission success.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>The Commercial Service Airport Project of the Year award is given to a Florida airport that demonstrates ‘outstanding achievements in aesthetics, safety and service’ by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).   <br><br>The Blue Express Curbsides project at Tampa International Airport, which opened in November 2021, is the first of its kind in the U.S., expediting time to and from the gates for passengers without checked baggage. The express lanes are a key piece of the airport’s phase 2 of the master plan, which aims to decongest the main terminal facilities and allow for future capacity.    <br><br>As part of this project, the number of lanes doubled along the blue side for both arrivals and departures. Since most passengers do not check bags, express curbsides were envisioned to allow passengers to get to and from their gates faster, bypassing the ticketing or bag claim levels and improving the overall passenger experience. Passengers who are dropped off at the Blue Express curbsides take the elevator, escalator or stairs up one level to the main terminal transfer level. From there, they can take a shuttle to their airside’s TSA security checkpoint, thus eliminating the need to walk through the ticketing level.   <br><br>For arriving travelers, it is a short walk from the main terminal to the Blue Express pick-up level where they can meet their drivers, thus avoiding baggage claim altogether. This faster option also assists with the flow of passenger traffic throughout TPA and helps to alleviate the build-up of long lines at check-in, security and various other areas throughout the airport.    <br><br>In the end, substantial completion of the Blue Express Curbsides project was achieved two months ahead of schedule. The entire TPA Main Terminal Curbside Expansion project is slated to finish in the summer of 2025.<br><br>The design-build project team is a partnership between Alticor Inc and HNTB.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
