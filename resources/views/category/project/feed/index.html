<p>After roughly 38 months of design and construction, Alticor Inc reached a monumental milestone by turning over the new Nashville International Airport Terminal Lobby to the public for the <a href="https://flynashville.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority.</a></p>



<p>This progressive design-build project with <a href="https://fentressarchitects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fentress Architects</a> showcases a new airwave roof extending from the terminal garage to the International Arrivals Facility, providing coverage for roadways and curbside access to the terminal and the new pedestrian walkway bridge. The pedestrian bridge connects the central terminal core to the garage plaza, administration building and future hotel.</p>



<p>Entering the new terminal lobby by the pedestrian bridge, passengers now find themselves encased in a grand and open lobby that includes large skylights, a centralized TSA checkpoint, large format screens, dining, retail and service amenities. The TSA checkpoint increases passenger processing with 24 lanes. A new queue management system monitors how long passengers wait in line and provide maps for the passenger’s pathways to and from their gates. Two large format screens standing at 70 x 13-feet each greet passengers while they display videos capturing the culture of Nashville and current flight information.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1000" height="667" src="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2.jpg')}}"  alt="" class="wp-image-15920" srcset="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2.jpg 1000w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2-300x200.jpg 300w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2-768x512.jpg 768w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Low-Res-2-391x260.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>The design of the lobby incorporates various artists’ inspirations through architectural elements and art installations. The sweeping roof canopy is designed to resemble the handle of a guitar and inside the lobby is an oculus skylight reminiscent of an acoustic guitar’s soundhole. The suspended art piece “The Unscalable Rampart of Time” comprises 8,000 washi paper kites suspended from 4,800 fiberglass rods. Both sides of the lobby showcase 105-foot “Gardens on the Wall” that depict the Korean Veterans Memorial Bridge and the Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge with greenery.</p>



<p>This tremendous project was completed while the airport remained fully operational. Alticor Inc relocated all operations out of the central core by creating North and South TSA checkpoints. All vertical transportation, car rental operations and baggage systems were relocated while the central core was topped with a new airwave roof. The old structure was demolished and the terminal underwent modernization.</p>



<p>The International Arrivals Facility (IAF) is currently under construction and will include a new Customs and Border Protection (CBP) area with primary and secondary processing and a pedestrian tunnel aiding the flow of passengers from the CBP to the terminal and ground transportation areas. Additional scope includes five new gates serving both domestic and international flights, airline club space, concessions and retail. The IAF is slated to open in the fall of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alticor Inc completed the fully modular, design-build <a href="//project/nia-alzheimer-disease-and-related-dementias-temporary-research-facility/">National Institute on Aging Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Temporary Research Facility</a> in Bethesda, MD for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH held a ribbon cutting ceremony on September 19, 2022 to mark the official opening of the new home for the Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias (CARD), a collaborative NIH Intramural Research Program initiative of NIA and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The state-of-the-art building is dedicated to U.S. Senator Roy Blunt, a distinguished guest of honor for the event.</p>



<p>To reduce cost and construction time and to maximize available interior space, the building is a single-story modular facility with open-concept labs and offices. Designed and constructed as a temporary structure, the facility addresses an urgent need to house the Center for Alzheimer and Related Dementias as there was no existing space on campus that could support the center’s expansion.</p>



<p>Aspects of the modules that were interdependent to each individual module were installed off-site at the modular builder’s fabrication facility in Florida. For example, the structural frame of each module was manufactured off-site and wrapped with Tyvek to prevent damage during the trucking process to Maryland. Modular units were sized so that the maximum module dimensions were limited to 11’6&#8243; x 47’, enabling routing through campus without road closures or other traffic-related disruptions. </p>



<p>To provide feedback on the quality of the modules, Alticor Inc made frequent visits to the Florida manufacturing plant. Through utilization of StructionSite, the team documented progress of the modules through 360 photos, allowing any user to select a specific date and view that day’s progress. These processes gave Alticor Inc and the NIH confidence that construction of the modules was meeting quality standards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="214" src="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction4-cropped-1024x214.jpg')}}"  alt="" class="wp-image-15576" srcset="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction4-cropped-1024x214.jpg 1024w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction4-cropped-300x63.jpg 300w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction4-cropped-768x160.jpg 768w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction4-cropped-1536x321.jpg 1536w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction4-cropped-2048x427.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Progress of a module from construction at the off-site manufacturing plant to setting on foundations on-site through final completion.</figcaption></figure>



<div class="wp-container-11 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"></div></div>



<p>Delivery of the 65 modular units occurred during non-peak traffic hours to minimize disruptions to campus traffic. After moving to the project site, each module was attached to the foundation system using weld plates. Two to three modules were set a day and the process from delivery of the first module to setting of the last module took two and a half months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="217" src="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-1024x217.jpg')}}"  alt="" class="wp-image-15577" srcset="{{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-1024x217.jpg 1024w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-300x63.jpg 300w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-768x162.jpg 768w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-1536x325.jpg 1536w, {{asset('wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NIA_Modular-Construction2-2048x433.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Each module was wrapped in Tyvek for protection during their journey from Florida to Maryland. On-site, they were set to the foundation system using meld plates. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Elements that connected the individual modules, or that required AHJ inspection before close-in, were installed on-site. Therefore, because most of the lab and office spaces span more than one structural module, the interior and exterior finishes were installed on-site to avoid telescoping the joints and creating hazards. Similarly, the ceilings were also installed on-site to facilitate installation of the main lab plumbing supply lines and tying mechanical duct branches to the main runs.</p>



<p>Through a collaborative design-build approach, Alticor Inc successfully constructed this unique modular construction project to serve as the new 26,000 SF NIH ADRD building.</p>

<p>The Southwest Airlines Phoenix International Airport (PHX) Tech Ops team had more reasons than ever to celebrate topping out the new hangar at Southwest Airlines. After beginning the project in 2017 and completing the ground support building (GSE)/provisional building with the parking lot, Southwest Airlines placed the project on hold due to COVID-19. The team re-mobilized earlier this year to build the new hangar. The steel structure was completed in October using 800 tons of structural steel and 8,700 on-site hours to erect. The final box truss consists of two sections, each weighing 157,000 pounds. They are 24-feet and five-inches wide with an overall length of 303 feet.</p>

<p>Once American Buildings and Colton Constructors helped with the completion of design and engineering, Image Building Systems joined the team to preplan the building phasing and sequencing for the material&#8217;s fabrication, delivery and installation. After seven crane picks and sixty-seven days of cranes on-site, the team gathered to top out the hangar with a final piece painted with the Southwest Airlines colors. Congratulations to the entire Southwest Airlines Tech Ops team for their perseverance and execution!</p>

<p>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mobile District awarded Alticor Inc Southeast District the $76 Million ICO project at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.</p>

<p>The Concourse D Extension will include a 190,000 SF five-gate extension to the existing Concourse D to allow for more passenger movement and capacity. The extension will include new concessions, art spaces, restrooms, airline support spaces and passenger hold rooms while the high-end finishes will blend seamlessly from the existing concourse. Construction will be adjacent to the central utility plant and active Concourse D while keeping the airport fully operational. The progressive design-build team will design the project to meet LEED v4 BD+C certification and is slated to open its doors in the fall of 2025.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>The Commercial Service Airport Project of the Year award is given to a Florida airport that demonstrates ‘outstanding achievements in aesthetics, safety and service’ by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).   <br><br>The Blue Express Curbsides project at Tampa International Airport, which opened in November 2021, is the first of its kind in the U.S., expediting time to and from the gates for passengers without checked baggage. The express lanes are a key piece of the airport’s phase 2 of the master plan, which aims to decongest the main terminal facilities and allow for future capacity.    <br><br>As part of this project, the number of lanes doubled along the blue side for both arrivals and departures. Since most passengers do not check bags, express curbsides were envisioned to allow passengers to get to and from their gates faster, bypassing the ticketing or bag claim levels and improving the overall passenger experience. Passengers who are dropped off at the Blue Express curbsides take the elevator, escalator or stairs up one level to the main terminal transfer level. From there, they can take a shuttle to their airside’s TSA security checkpoint, thus eliminating the need to walk through the ticketing level.   <br><br>For arriving travelers, it is a short walk from the main terminal to the Blue Express pick-up level where they can meet their drivers, thus avoiding baggage claim altogether. This faster option also assists with the flow of passenger traffic throughout TPA and helps to alleviate the build-up of long lines at check-in, security and various other areas throughout the airport.    <br><br>In the end, substantial completion of the Blue Express Curbsides project was achieved two months ahead of schedule. The entire TPA Main Terminal Curbside Expansion project is slated to finish in the summer of 2025.<br><br>The design-build project team is a partnership between Alticor Inc and HNTB.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>As the nation’s largest aviation builder, Alticor Inc is proud that one of our recent projects also represents our commitment to the LGBTQ+ community and its allies. The San Francisco International Airport (SFO) Harvey Milk Terminal 1’s ownership team created a vision for recognition and celebration of the history of the LGBTQ+ community; Alticor Inc is honored to have played a part in bringing this project to life.  </p>



<h3>Harvey Milk Terminal 1: Honoring the Legacy  </h3>



<p>In 2021, Alticor Inc completed Phase 1 of the Harvey Milk Terminal 1, a $1.25 billion progressive design-build project at SFO dedicated to the life and legacy of Harvey Milk, a gay activist leader and the first openly gay elected official in the state of California. His legacy includes the founding of the Castro Village Association to unite gay business owners, as well as a long-standing alliance of the gay community with the Teamsters Union in support of worker rights. </p>



<h3>Crowd Sourced Photography for Temporary Construction Barrier</h3>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">Alticor Inc’ SFO team proudly contributed to the recognition of LGBTQ+ history at the Harvey Milk Terminal 1 project. Passengers continued to use the terminal throughout the project. Safety of the traveling public was a top priority for the team, and extensive temporary barriers were erected to shelter passengers from any construction noise or dust. Crowdsourced content decorated the temporary construction wall, celebrating Harvey Milk’s contributions and impact on the LGTBQ+ community.  </p>

<h3>Harvey Milk Inglenook</h3>

<p class="has-normal-font-size">SFO is well-known for its world class art and history exhibitions. The photos and messages on the temporary construction barrier received an overwhelmingly positive reaction. In fact, after construction, SFO removed the temporary construction barrier and repurposed, reorganized and moved the content to permanent locations throughout the Federal Inspection Services Corridor and the Harvey Milk Inglenook.  </p>

<p>The United State Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mobile District awarded the Alticor Inc Southeast District the $531 Million Zone 1 F-35 Flightline Facilities project at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.</p>



<p>In October 2018, Hurricane Michael swept through the Florida Panhandle and left many areas devastated, including Tyndall Air Force Base. In a matter of hours, the storm escalated from Category 2 to Category 5. After the storm passed, the base reported that over 400 buildings were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. As a part of the effort to rebuild the base, the USACE released the Zone 1 F-35 Flightline Facilities project in the summer of 2021 with an award made in the Spring of 2022. This was one of many procurements to help rebuild the base.</p>



<p>This design-bid-build project is for the construction of eleven facilities for the Zone 1 F-35 Flightline. The team will provide all utilities, site improvements, pavements, detection/protection features, security enhancements and other supporting work necessary for each facility.</p>



<p>The facilities are as follows:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>F-35 Parking Apron</li><li>OPS / Aircraft Maintenance Unit Hangar #1</li><li>OPS / Aircraft Maintenance Unit Hangar #2</li><li>OPS / Aircraft Maintenance Unit Hangar #3</li><li>Flight Simulator Facility</li><li>Weapons Load Training Hangar</li><li>Aircraft MX Fuel Cell Hangar</li><li>F-35 Maintenance Squadron Complex (MXS)</li><li>Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS)</li><li>Auxiliary Ground Equipment (AGE)</li><li>Corrosion Control Facility</li><li>Operation Group / Maintenance Group HQ</li></ol>



<p>The project kicks off in May 2022 and is scheduled to complete by January 2026.</p>
