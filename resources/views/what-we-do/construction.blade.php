                                        accomplish this by selecting highly qualified team members who understand the
                                        value of fluid communication, streamlined decision-making, and integrated

                                        Alticor Inc uses VDC to visualize the construction process, quantify the scope,
                                        schedule construction activities, and improve quality. VDC helps foster
                                        collaboration by involving owners, architects, engineers and trades in a unified
                                        virtual environment where the team can anticipate and mitigate conflicts prior

                                        and construction account for approximately 20 percent of the total cost of a
                                        building during its lifetime. The remaining 80 percent will be spent on
                                        operations and maintenance over the life of the facility. Too often, up-front
                                        cost savings sabotage long-term performance.<br />

                                        first cost decisions and performance expectations for a completed building.
                                        Initial savings may be dwarfed by unforeseen expenditures when operations over
                                        time conflict with the building’s actual use. We make sure that doesn’t happen.

                                    <p>When a project calls for construction on a tight and impacted site,
                                        prefabrication and modularization can help alleviate congestion by expanding the
                                        construction area to include off-site manufacturing and assembly facilities.
                                        Many building components can be built or assembled more efficiently under
                                        controlled factory conditions that improve quality while reducing costs –
                                        without having to work around the difficulties of inclement weather. The
                                        components are delivered to the site “just in time” for integration on the
                                        project, reducing the amount of site space devoted to storage of parts and
                                        components.</p>
                                    <p>Additional efficiency is realized when our trade partners become installers
