										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Alticor Inc is currently providing design-build services on the Main Terminal Curbside Expansion program at Tampa International Airport (TPA). The major renovation is designed to create a new set of express arrival and departure lanes for passengers who have no need for curbside services, ticketing or checking luggage. This allows all passengers who are not checking bags with airlines to access the “Express Curb”, which bypasses the ticket lobby entirely and provides direct access to the gates. The innovation reduces curbside congestion while providing a new and enhanced level of customer service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The project includes the expansion of 32 lanes from 16, incorporating both at-grade and elevated roadways along with Vertical Circulation Buildings (VCB) for both TPA’s Blue Side and Red Side. The VCB&#8217;s are three-floor air-conditioned atriums that provide direct access from the new express curbsides to the Transfer Level of the Main Terminal via elevators, escalators and enclosed walkways. These buildings also connect to the adjacent Long Term Parking Garage on the Blue Side and Marriott Hotel on the Red Side. The Red Side VCB also includes a Shuttle Platform that will connect with the future Airside D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Blue Side VCB opened to the public two months ahead of schedule in November 2021, just in time for passengers to enjoy the benefits of the new curbsides ahead of the busy holiday season. Once inside the VCB, passengers are greeted by two large wall art installations, glass wall panels, stainless steel column covers, terrazzo floors throughout and an intricate monumental staircase as the centerpiece. Passengers can then take the elevator, escalator or stairs up one level to the Main Terminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Blue Side VCB phase of the program also includes the replacement of the existing central utility plant (CUP) with a new 4,800-ton capacity plant, which went online just before the 2021 holiday season. The new CUP and Electrical Service Building is housed in a 10,000 SF building and provides heating, cooling, potable water and fire protection for the Main Terminal, Baggage Handling, Network Operations Center, Sky Connect station, new Vertical Circulation Buildings and the Authority’s new Maintenance and Police Headquarters. The new highly efficient chiller plant reduces overall energy costs by 30%, equal to removing 620 cars from the roads and 50 million gallons of potable water per year. The design features cast-in-place concrete cooling towers that double as an illuminated waterfall feature and multi-colored pipe jacketing that each represent heating, fire protection, water and power to the airport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Other significant features of the Red Side phase of the project include the renovation of the loading dock, replacement of the FAA parking lot, replacement of the existing curbsides’ architectural ceilings, construction of a new Police and Maintenance Department Building and demolition of the existing administration building. The project is on a very tight site and constructs the adjoining terminal building expansions and curbside roadway expansions while maintaining 100% passenger’s pedestrian and vehicle access to the terminal throughout construction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The new Harbor-UCLA Medical Center Redevelopment Program will consolidate medical services into new facilities on the 72-acre campus and ensure Harbor-UCLA Medical Center complies with Senate Bill 1953, which takes effect in 2030 and requires all California hospitals to be structurally resilient in the event of a major earthquake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The project consists of new construction of a 545,000 SF acute care inpatient tower with 346 beds, a helicopter landing pad and a warehouse; a 370,000 SF outpatient treatment and support building and 508,000 SF above-grade parking structure; a 23,000 SF facilities and IT support building, a 34,000 SF regional laboratory building and a new 11,000 SF central plant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Consolidating inpatient and outpatient services into new buildings that optimize operational effectiveness, the project will reduce operation and maintenance costs, provide outpatient facilities that accommodate planned patient visits, implement Los Angeles County’s LEED requirements by incorporating sustainable design features and create a campus designed for the well-being of patients and staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Requiring LEED Gold certification, the medical center upgrade will develop a modern campus that serves the community’s healthcare needs while also aiming to protect the environment in which it is built.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The LAUSD Belvedere Middle School Comprehensive Modernization is an all-inclusive enhancement of the site, buildings, infrastructure, accessibility and security measures of the 527,000 SF operational campus. The project consolidates all but one of the existing 21 buildings into six new structures consisting of technology-enabled classrooms, labs and other support spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the many upgrades include 24 modernized classrooms and six laboratories, integrated special education environments, dedicated performing arts spaces, upgraded food services, a new gymnasium and all new ball courts and playfields. Complete ADA upgrades allow universal accessibility across the site, and the dense campus plan reduces travel distances between buildings for both students and faculty. The buildings are organized around a central plaza, and in combination with the architectural porch concept used at each building entry, this arrangement acknowledges the historical context of the surrounding community while promoting security on an open campus. Large murals, completed by local artists, are Integrated throughout the campus resulting in a wholly modernized learning environment that elevates the student and faculty experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">The City of Hope Orange County comprehensive cancer campus at Irvine’s FivePoint Gateway is being developed in partnership with FivePoint, an owner and developer of large mixed-use, master-planned communities in California. The cancer campus will bring highly specialized care, clinical trials, precision medicine and early detection closer to home. Housed on 11 acres, it will include Orange County’s only specialty hospital exclusively focused on treating and curing cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The new City of Hope Orange County project will include the following:<br />
&#8211; An outpatient center offering diagnostic imaging and screenings, precision medicine and early detection, medical oncology, etc.<br />
&#8211; A clinical research center offering phase I-III clinical trials.<br />
&#8211; Personalized supportive care services, upheld as a model for other institutions across the country, to address physical and emotional issues that can arise during treatment.<br />
&#8211; Access to a wide range of solid tumor and blood cancer specialists dedicated to finding the best treatments for each patient.<br />
&#8211; Additional clinical locations that will provide medical oncology and infusion services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Outpatient Building (OSHPD 3) will be built out in an existing 191,000 gross square foot, four stories, core and shell office building. The primary services of this center are subspecialty cancer exams and treatment, a research center and ambulatory surgery. The specialty hospital (OSHPD 1) of 120 beds will be newly constructed adjacent to this existing structure. In addition, two parking structures to support these buildings are to be constructed. The construction of the specialty hospital is currently anticipated to start after the opening of the Outpatient Building due to design and permitting timelines for this OSHPD project.</p>
