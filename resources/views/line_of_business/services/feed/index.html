										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Mary D. Nichols Campus is the new regional headquarters for the California Air Resources Board (CARB). This project consolidated CARB’s seven locations throughout Los Angeles into a single location in Riverside that houses more than 400 employees. The state-of-the-art facility includes an extended range of dedicated test cells for testing of light to heavy-duty vehicles, an advanced chemistry laboratory and workspace for accommodating new test methods for future generations of vehicles. The project includes space for developing enhanced onboard diagnostics and portable emissions measurement systems, visitor reception and education areas, a media center, flexible conference areas and a large public auditorium.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">The new campus is one of the most extensive and advanced vehicle emissions testing and research facilities in the world. It was designed and built to reach the highest possible levels of measured sustainability: LEED Platinum certification, Net Zero Energy and CalGreen Tier 2. It is the largest true Net Zero Energy facility of its type in the world — producing as much energy as it uses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">The unique design provides a seamless consolidation and integration of the office program into a three-story, pinwheel-shaped building that offers vertical connectivity to increase proximity between offices and horizontal connectivity with testing areas, support space and laboratories, resulting in greater flexibility and interaction. This pinwheel concept creates a central command control area that forms the nexus of the new CARB campus. The high-performance campus features ample open and green spaces, as well as nature walks for al fresco breaks and informal meetings alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The two-phase <a href="https://www.delta.com/">Delta Air Lines</a> Terminals 2 &amp; 3 Modernization Program at LAX will enable co-location with airline partners in Terminals 2, 3, and Tom Bradley International Terminal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Phase 1 will feature a new four-level central headhouse connecting Terminals 2 and Terminal 3. The headhouse will include the Arrivals/Baggage Claim Level, new TSA baggage inspection system, ticketing, TSA security checkpoint, Delta Operations space and new club space on the top level. The new three-level concourse connects the existing west headhouse and the new central headhouse to the Terminal 3 satellite. This includes the apron level with baggage sortation, gates, hold rooms, concessions and Delta operations space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Phase 2 will include the demolition and replacement of the west headhouse which links the LAMP project (LAX train system) to Terminal 3 as well as the central headhouse, Terminal 3 concourse and a new connector to Tom Bradley International Terminal. The Terminal 3 satellite will also be renovated, and the building will be redesigned to include apron level offices for ramp functions and the passenger level for gate access.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">This project provides all the amenities that Delta’s customers have come to expect at LAX, including a private Delta One check-in lounge, new Delta Sky Clubs, fast check-in for Delta shuttle services and an integrated in-line baggage system. When completed, the facility will offer convenient passenger flows, sufficient gate-area seating and a world-class concession program.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center">About the Project</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Meeting the growing need of this border community, the Alticor Inc design-build team designed and constructed this seven-story, OSHPD 1, inpatient bed tower. Three floors of the 32-bed unit in Medical-Surgical Nursing make up the bulk of the tower, with patient rooms flanking both the eastern and western sides for views with natural lighting. Each room has three distinct areas for patients, staff and visitors. The central core of the facility houses physician and nursing functions, such as call stations, for quick and effective responses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Within the 106-bed tower, there is a grand two-story lobby on the ground floor, with separate surgery and ICU waiting rooms—placed adjacent to courtyards and healing gardens. Behind a secure, clean corridor, there is a six-unit surgery suite with a hybrid operating room, 24-unit PACU/Pre-Op unit and a 10-bed ICU. The combined surgery and ICU provides adequate nurse staffing and decreased patient movement for a safer environment. To further elevate the experience, the hospital “redefined dining” with a servery located on the top floor, providing 270-degree views of the ocean and chaparral-covered hills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The City of Dallas Aviation Department manages multiple aviation facilities within the city limits of Dallas. The largest of these is Dallas Love Field, which has been undergoing a major renovation through the Love Field Modernization Program (LFMP). Alticor Inc was selected as the Construction Manager-at-Risk for the overall LFMP, with a construction budget of $274 million. This program marks the largest and most ambitious construction effort at Dallas Love Field Airport since its establishment in the 1950s – a complete terminal renovation and the addition of a new concourse, ticketing hall, and baggage claim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CONSTRUCTION</h3>
<p>During pre-construction, Alticor Inc assisted Southwest Airlines with preliminary budgets, schedules, and complex sequencing required to deliver a project of this magnitude without impacting daily airport operations. As part of the $519 million capital improvement initiative, the project required demolition of the existing terminals (and their combined 20 gates) and replacement with a new 20-gate, T-shaped, central concourse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new design, developed by Corgan Architects, presents a new modern ticketing hall used by all airlines, an expanded baggage claim hall, a renovated and expanded main lobby, and three existing concourses replaced by one single concourse. The design maintains the basics for which Love Field is known – passenger convenience, operational efficiency and maintainability. The project has achieved LEED Silver certification and incorporates several innovative environmentally friendly concepts.</p>
<h3>FACILITY SERVICES</h3>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">Alticor Inc supported the City of Dallas Aviation Department with their current facility maintenance operations and developed a facility operations and maintenance plan. </span><span style="color: #333333;">As is often the case with modernization projects, changes in systems and structures will often drive changes to maintenance programs that can be difficult for management to recognize and effectively implement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #333333;">Following the complete 20-gate terminal and new passenger concourse makeover at Dallas Love Field, the City of Dallas entered into a consulting agreement with Alticor Inc Services to analyze their current facility maintenance practices, organizational structure and maintenance budget, and to provide subject matter experts (SMEs) to determine where efficiencies could be realized. The SMEs from Alticor Inc utilized industry benchmark data, along with their extensive experience in facility management, to develop a model facility operations and maintenance plan for Love Field, the Dallas Executive Airport, and the City Heliport.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">The project entailed renovating and upgrading the look and feel of the Westfield Terminal 2 concourse at LAX with a design that was dynamic, visually appealing, and unexpected in an airport environment. This included: renovating and expanding food and beverage and retail locations throughout the terminal, finishing and adding furniture upgrades to the hold rooms, restroom replacement and relocation, adding an iconic staircase to entice travelers to the mezzanine level and upgrading infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Construction was over an 18-month period, and the airport remained operational 24/7, requiring successful coordination between the client, other airlines, government agencies, the airport, and the City of Los Angeles to minimize operational impacts and maintain a positive passenger experience.</p>
