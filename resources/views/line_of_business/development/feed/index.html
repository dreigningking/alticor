										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Orthopedic Hospital Medical Magnet High School is located in Los Angeles, and students from Los Angeles Unified School District that have an interest in the medical and science fields can apply for enrollment in the school. With a capacity of 800 students, the high school is located on property donated by the adjacent Orthopedic Hospital.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Development</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">Alticor Inc Development completed the development and construction of the new Orthopaedic Hospital Medical Magnet High School. At the time, the project was awarded under a new contracting approach by the LAUSD in which Alticor Inc Development was responsible for providing construction financing for the project and, upon completion, selling the project back to LAUSD.  This project demonstrated Alticor Inc Development’s strengths and expertise in the areas of development, project financing, Public Private Partnerships (P3) and project management/owner’s representation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Construction</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">This high school is made up of two two-story buildings that are constructed about 250 feet apart from each other with covered canopies and a covered lunch shelter between the buildings. The basketball and volleyball courts are also located between the buildings. The high school includes a large multipurpose room, cafeteria, media center, bookstore, administration offices, weight room and 32 classrooms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p>The Allure Apollo project is the second phase of a three-phase, mixed-use, multifamily, transit-oriented Apollo development. Allure includes 384 Class-A apartment units consisting of 18 studio units, 176 one-bedroom units, and 190 two-bedroom units. An above-ground parking garage serves residents and can accommodate 650 cars. Once complete, all phases of development will create an urban town center development adjacent to the Branch Avenue Metro Station located in Camp Springs, MD. The town center will introduce a new retail center and office space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is a combination of 3A (six stories wood frame over podium) and 5A (six stories wood frame) construction which wraps around a precast concrete-structured parking garage. The multifamily apartments carry high level finishes including granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and electronic controlled access to common areas and apartments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allure Apollo also includes a large amenities package. Indoor amenities include a theater, bar, card room, game room, fitness and yoga studio, conference space, and club room. The outdoor amenities include a courtyard area with a pool, bocce ball court, zen garden and extensive landscaping package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, Alticor Inc completed construction of the first phase of the master plan, <a href="https://www.henselphelps.com/project/ascend-apollo/">Ascend Apollo</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Hotel Indigo, situated in the East Village District in San Diego, is an oasis amidst the urban chaos of everyday life. This hotel is blocks away from Petco Park and the historic Gaslamp District.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">Alticor Inc Development was selected by InterContinental Hotels Group to develop the 210-key Hotel Indigo. Alticor Inc Development was responsible for all design, financing, construction and fit-out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">CONSTRUCTION</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">This 12-story hotel consisted of a post-tension, cast-in-place concrete structure with a façade that was designed to provide transparency from the street to the public spaces for maximum visibility. The hotel includes a podium at street grade that rests above a two-level, 65-stall, subterranean cast-in-place parking garage.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the Project</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">With 756 guest rooms including 20 suites, this 20-story hotel offers more rooms than any other hotel in Baltimore. Its 25,000 SF grand ballroom is the city’s largest, complemented by a 15,000 SF junior ballroom and an additional 22,000 SF of flexible function space. Additional hotel amenities include a 290-seat full-service restaurant, food and beverage outlets, a fitness center, a business center, street-level retail space, and 550-space underground parking garage.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Baltimore Development Corporation selected Alticor Inc Development as the developer and design-builder of the city’s new Convention Center Headquarters Hotel. Alticor Inc Development was responsible for overseeing the purchasing and installation of the Furnishing Fixtures &amp; Equipment (FF&amp;E), Operating Supplies &amp; Equipment (OS&amp;E), and the Special System components (Telephone, Computer &amp; Data, P.O.S., Hotel Management Systems, Audio Visual, CCTV, and the Security Systems).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">CONSTRUCTION</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">New pedestrian bridges constructed over active rail lines and arterial roadways link the hotel to adjacent attractions. The hotel was designed to blend and compliment its historic surroundings, using a partial brick facade that mimics the adjacent ballpark and incorporating a series of blues and earth tones throughout the facility, inspired by the area’s harbor and wetlands. Spanning the top of the hotel’s amenities areas, a 32,000 SF green roof system helps to reduce stormwater runoff, decreases the heat-island effect of the city’s other blacktop roofs, and contributes to enhanced energy efficiency.</p>
